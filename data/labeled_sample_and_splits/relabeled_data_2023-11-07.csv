","I am just shocked by the HATE Reddit is giving Pakistan as if it was one single entity. I agree we have a horrible economy, security problems and massive corruption. What I don't get is most of your keyboard political scientists overlook the complexities of the situation. We are trying to run a democracy here, the shit you're trying to spread throughout the world by massacring civilians in the hopes of toppling an asshole or two from power. Democracy just doesn't come overnight, its the process of filtration over time till people get sick of the same assholes. Just like you geniuses elected George Bush twice. Yes we do have rogue elements in the ISI. Its an intelligence agency. They have secrets, just like the CIA. You can never be for certain because that's how these organizations work. Just like that CIA agent that shot a few civillians/agents tailing him in Pakistan. HOW the FUCK can you justify going into another sovereign land, killing their locals and then claim diplomatic immunity? Furthermore, how the hell do you expect the ISI to operate if they do not have infiltration/ties to the Al-Qaeda? Telepathy? Pakistan is a dynamic country with an Urban and Rural population, our nukes are not neatly lined up in a row under spotlights with shiny buttons labeled 'FIRE AT USA/ISRAEL' in 20 different languages with no safeties. Our massive military budget is not spent on purchasing mountains of gummy bears to fill giant crystal swimming pools with. No one EVER got the chance to implant a tracking chip in OBL's anus. Most of the locals have beards, carry guns in Pakistan, something like Texas. People do not necessarily nose around at their neighbourhoods. His 'mansion' is a pretty common sight in Pakistan. Every city has at least a few dozen of those. That's like me finding my lost puppy in your backyard and then giving you shit for it. I may be totally wrong on this but the point is, no one knows for sure. All we know is shit regurgitated by the media and i am a cynic. We DO have a right to protect our borders, what do you want us to do oh so benevolent Ally? Thank you for calling us an ally, levelling entire neighbourhoods in the hopes of maybe getting one or two wanted people? So lets say a drone kills 20 people. Its ok, theyre just smelly brown people, so let's just ignore the humane aspect to it. Let's just bomb and kill 20. So what, we got 1 wanted terrrrrist. What about the other 19? What about the other 19's relatives? Gonna kill them too? Because common sense would dictate they're pissed. Doesn't really win the hearts and minds does it? And then you wonder why they harboured a fugitive? AMERICA, spreading freedom and democracy through military force running on fuel obtained from a Monarchy......Fucking hypocrites. Disclaimer: I know the USA isnt a single entity either, get your government and uneducated idiots in check too and we'll try to do the same. I also know it's not just the USA in the region but i am just pissed on the fact that with allies like USA, who needs enemies. I know it goes both ways. /rage /rant.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

","I know everyone's energised at the moment but let's keep a little perspective. Sure they may later turn out to be Zionist bedfellows in practice; certainly there's some people in the cabinet that might raise a few eyebrows on that score, but what has actually been said? 'An attack on Iran cannot be ruled out.' Well, when I'm playing poker and have a 2 and an 8 I never tell everybody that I'm ruling out pocket aces. I want everyone to know that I maintain the most influential hand. Even if Hague, behind closed doors, later admits that he'd rather have climbed into a bag of snakes than get intoanotherwar, especially one this time with Iran, I wouldn't expect him to say that in public. He can still enter talks and make conciliatory gestures with Iran whilst saying that until there is resolution nothing can be ruled out. Maybe morally he shouldn't bluff ambiguity, but politically the little Machiavelli in me tells me that maybe he should. Even if it's not even a remote intention. As for changing laws which prevent Israeli officials being prosecuted in Britain; well that's a million miles from saying Israeli officials shouldn't face the International Court of Justice in The Hague. They could well have learnt a lesson from the 1980s and be putting it into practice. They used to prevent Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, widely recognised as the political wing of the IRA, from speaking on television. It was a pantomime of having an actor read his words over his own muted voice. It was only when they provided Sinn Fein with a voice and a chance to embrace diplomatic means of progressing their agenda or to enter talks did things start to get better. The Downing Street Declaration followed and the Good Friday Agreement thereafter. Now, I am completely opposed to Israel's actions in the West Bank and Gaza. They broke the ceasefire, they carried out war crimes. There is currently a policy of ethnic cleansing. That is not to excuse Hamas but here's the interesting thing... The US, Israel and the EU all recognise Hamas as a terrorist organization.*The UK does not.*Neither does Australia. Neither did Germany or France want to recognise them as such, at the time, but a voting bloc in the EU out voted their thinking. Exactly the same thinking that was applied to Northern Ireland with positive results. As long as the Hamas leadership is recognised not as a terrorist entity but a political party, as it rightly should in my opinion, then it is only right that protection is provided in the UK for their Israeli counterparts. This way Britain is able to play the role of intermediary. They're also able,ifthey were to wish to play it this way in future, to both chastise Israel for its actions, allow the channels for discussion to be opened and still maintain full diplomatic relations. To take delegations from both Gaza and Israel. Maybe people should boycott Israeli goods. The IAEA should certainly not be afraid of questioning their weapons program. The International Court should be looking into their action. But I can very much see why both Hamas and Israeli officials should be able to come to the UK without threat of reprisal.The problem's too much fighting and not enough talking. We should be looking at ways to tear down obstacles not putting them up. If that means you have to talk to a 'Gerry Adams' then you talk to him. We've done the same with Hamas, we should do the same with Israel.*",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0
6,"UN Chief: Israel occupation 'morally and politically unsustainable, must end'
","Erich Fromm.. 1958: "" It is often said that the Arabs fled, that they left the country voluntarily, and that they therefore bear the responsibility for losing their property and their land. It is true that in history there are some instances — in Rome and in France during the Revolutions when enemies of the state were proscribed and their property confiscated. But in general international law, the principle holds true that no citizen loses his property or his rights of citizenship; and the citizenship right is de facto a right to which the Arabs in Israel have much more legitimacy than the [European] Jews. Just because the Arabs fled? Since when is that punishable by confiscation of property and by being barred from returning to the land on which a people's forefathers have lived for generations? Thus, the claim of the Jews to the land of Israel cannot be a realistic political claim. If all nations would suddenly claim territories in which their forefathers had lived two thousand years ago, this world would be a madhouse. ... I believe that, politically speaking, there is only one solution for Israel, namely, the unilateral acknowledgement of the obligation of the State towards the Arabs — not to use it as a bargaining point, but to acknowledge the complete moral obligation of the Israeli State to its former inhabitants of Palestine.

12,"Israel and Palestine: Toddling to talks about talks
","Just to show what the propagandist are alluding to by saying there was never a 'country' named Palestine. One should look up the 1922 White Paper which sets out what was meant by a ""Jewish home land"" , which makes it clear that Palestine was indeed considered a nation, though not independent:""'it is contemplated that the status of all citizens of Palestine in the eyes of the law shall be Palestinian, and it has never been intended that they, or any section of them, should possess any other juridical status..."": To be a citizen of a state, that state has to exist. Therefore one cannot deny Palestine existence as a state, unless one is an irrational fanatic. Contrary to popular belief, the borders of Palestine were not defined in the texts of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, The San Remo conference, The Treaty of Sèvres, the Treaty of Lausanne, or even by the British Mandate of Palestine. The only official maps to have been drawn up for partition are by the UN: If one was to apply the agreements on Palestine, they would be as follows: The Palestine position is this. If we deal with our commitments, there is first the general pledge to Hussein in October 1915, under which Palestine was included in the areas as to which Great Britain pledged itself that they should be Arab and independent in the future. November 1917, when Mr Balfour, with the authority of the War Cabinet, issued his famous declaration to the Zionists that Palestine 'should be the national home of the Jewish people, but that nothing should be done to prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. White Paper of 1939:His Majesty's Government believe that the framers of the Mandate in which the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab population of the country.His Majesty's Government therefore now declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State against their will.The objective of His Majesty's Government is the establishment within 10 years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and strategic requirements of both countries in the future.

","Hi, Israeli here. The amount of propaganda that goes into this whole issue is just disgusting. Not saying it doesn't come from both sides, but let's put the Turkish aid ship at Gaza as an example. What happened was a Turkish ship populated with Palestinians was going to cross a border it had no authority to. Israelis told them to stop, they would bring the aid to the intended recipients for them but they weren't allowed to cross the border. This warning was issued several times. It was ignored, and then IDF soldiers came by helicopter to quell the issue with explicit directions to NOT fire unless the commander had no choice but to tell them to. When they boarded the ship, they were attacked with clubs by Palestinians. The Israelis proceeded to shoot in self defense and ended up wounding several civilians. What was the media response? ""ISRAELI'S ATTACK CIVILLIANS ON AN AID SHIP"". I will be the first person to agree with the implications of the joke that Israelis are rude people. Whenever I visit Israel I have to remember there are no such things as lines and if I get bumped into on the street there's no use waiting for the apology. BUT this rudeness doesn't translate the kinds of people Israelis are. Yeah, we can be some seriously obnoxious dickheads sometimes on the shallow level. But I know that if for some reason I desperately needed shelter because of some awful incident, the FIRST, random house I knock on will warmly take me in and treat me like their child. Yeah, Israel can be an asshole, but on the individual level, they care even more than Americans do. Let's just take into account for a second what happened with Gilad Shalit the kidnapped soldier. After two years of his captivity, we made an exchange with the Palestinians. In exchange for his return home, we gave them ONE THOUSAND terrorist prisoners. What the hell does that say about our regard for a human life? This conflict is ugly and it's been perpetuated by both sides. But Israelis almost aren't given a choice. We have tried on multiple counts to compromise with the Palestinians, and it's always been met with resistance. There are rockets shooting into Israel as you read this. We allow them citizenship if they desire it. They can live in the state. But all they want is for us to get the hell out and they are unwilling to compromise. I get it. We invaded the land, that's kind of a dick thing to do. But Jerusalem, the land which we share with all who wish to be a part of it, is deeply ingrained in our history, and after the Holocaust, we needed somewhere to go. We extend peace to those who wish for it. They don't. They just want us out and attack us every hour of every day and when we attack back, we are labeled the bad guys. What we have NEVER done is purposely attack the innocent. On multiple occasions they have placed the innocent in front of themselves as shields and then the media shits on our faces. I know this sounds incredibly biased, but please look into the facts rather than conforming to the views of biased media outlets. Please become more informed. I understand that this was an incredibly proIsrael post and that Palestine has its own argument. But there is so much bullshit that goes out into the media. I'm a native Hebrew speaking Israeli born and raised in America. My views are less extreme than those who grew up in Israel. I, unlike my parents, think this conflict can be resolved if we actively foster friendships among Israeli and Muslim youth. Two of my close friends in college are Muslim. I don't have an agenda against Muslims. But I have a serious problem when Israel becomes the bad guy. Please, do your research.

","For those too lazy to go to Google Translate: German intelligence knew Eichmann hiding in 1952 For years, Israeli agents tracked behind the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, after all, they grabbed him in 1960 in Argentina.

Berlin His hiding place was apparently known in Germany.

This was clear from an entry of 1952 in the BND file shows to Eichmann, the ""Bild"" newspaper reported on Saturday. Eichmann was during the National Socialism in Germany, largely responsible for organizing the deportation and murder of European Jews.

","Those crafty Iranians. It's all about 'theater dominance'. Iran wants their very own big red button of win. Why must there be a war in this region? Because the Iranians, a country of 72 million people, are working like fuck to centrifuge enough uranium into fissionable goodness. They need that red button fast and for pretty good reasons. The Iranians have noticed that when you get named a member country of the ""Axis of Evil"" possibly the best way to maintain sovereignty is to fast track some uranium into something blowable. It worked for North Korea. Iran figures, since it's surrounded on all sides by Americans, maybe the only route to autonomy and stopping the Americans grabbing all your oil is a nuke. There's also a time factor built into this equation. The Iranians are probably at most 2 years away from having enough gunk cobbled together to set off their very own big one. If and when they do, Israel will have to play ball and get serious about giving the Palestinians a fair deal. That's what happens when you lose theater dominance. You end up having to negotiate.

That doesn't even make sense and would be the quickest way for him to turn 5000 years of Persian history into toilet paper. The Iranians aren't stupid. The Israeli response would be 200+ nukes reducing Iran to a post apocalyptic wasteland. Iran just needs that nuke for insurance. For deterrence.

27,"Why Aren't Arab States - Instead of the U.S., France and Britain - Taking Care of Libya?
","The big elephant in the room is the hypocrisy behind the UN decision to intervene with Libya at all. Now im not saying what they are doing, mostly China and Russia, is wrong. Khadaffi is clearly bat shit crazy at this point, but so are about 15+ other dictators around the world, What makes Libya justifiable to intervene with? more so than say Syria, Yemen or most of the African nations? Simple fact, the amount of gains to be had by calming the situation and preventing Khadaffi from worsening the problems already caused. We can all believe in the good of mankind and trust that the only reason is to support the people, but its naive to believe that when atrocities such as people in Bahrain are currently undergoing. In Libya, Khadaffi is fighting an armed freedom ""revolutionaries"", in Bahrain securities are shooting down demonstrators and entering private homes and killing innocents. You as myself might wonder why isn't Bahrain brought before the UN counsel, why aren't they getting international sanctions? Well its mostly because of this, the country is in a key position for both the Arab and the western world. Bahrain is a very strategic important placed country for the oil reserves in that region. The US has its 5th naval fleet HQ there as well as fighter-plane stations around the country. Its a very important country for the US and thus a very important country for NATO. The Sunni Muslim King Harald is well affiliated with the US and thus is allowed A LOT more wiggle room for bad behavior than his surrounding buddies in that region. Any interference from America or any western world affiliated with America, can bring a rejection from Bahrain as their comfy military vacation place. But Bahrain is also a important place for the Arab nations, especially important for the 6 members of the Golf counsel GCC, where Saudi-Arabia plays a major role. The GCC works politically, militarily and economically, in the geopolitical game the main enemy for them is Iran. Bahrain is a country of 70% Shia Muslims, and the government is afraid the shia Muslims will rise up and take over the control, in the same manner Saudi-Arabia has a high quantity of Shia Muslims, and fear that the latest revolutionary domino effect will be transferred from Bahrain to them, thus they sent out 1000+ soldiers to ""help"" the government. So from the Western world, we have Bahrain as a key strategic point for oil, terrorism control, and potential Iran conflicts, and from the Arab world we have direct involvement and support, And this alone is why Bahrain is not even considered a violation. But then how come Libya was chosen by the UN ? Well first and foremost, Libya has the largest oil reserve in Africa, that alone warrants the interest of US and its allied England and France. Khadaffi even went too batshit crazy for the world UN countries and really got their attention when he expressed his will to set aflame the oil reserves, which would result in global oil price change and economical issues. But along with its neighbor Egypt, Libya also is a strategic point of interest for western countries, mostly US, providing access to terrorist prisoner camps, protection of Israel and the access to the Arab world. But why didn't the west intervene with Egypt?, well for most part they didn't know the outcome of the play, so if they went with Mubarak, they would either have a world look down upon them as traitors to democracy if he won or lost, or if they went with the protesters, then if Mubarak got what he wanted, he would most definitely not be friendly anymore, So the best option for THE WEST was to not intervene at all, but in this case Khadaffi has already become hostile, so intervention became a must. Well Therein lies the hypocrisy of world governments, its not about right or wrong, its about the potential gains and the potential losses, every move is a strategic and selfish one.

28,"Palestinians make surprisingly large land offer to Israel: Giving up twice the West Bank territory
","This title, and the article are fairly deceptive. Firstly, here is the actual WSJ article. Whatever the offer made by the Palestinians is, it is more likely an expression of willingness to include more land in a potential land swap. The purpose of a land swap in the context of the delineation of borders between Israel and a future Palestinian state is recognizing that a few of the largest settlements (situated along the Green Line) have grown too large to move inside the Green Line. These areas aren't usually so contentious. A larger problem is if it is arable land or not. The West Bank land that is presumed to be a part of any land swap is some of the most fertile land, and Israel's previous offers usually involve arid desert land that would be attached to Gaza. While Gaza desperately needs more land (it is the most densely populated area in the world), Palestinians are not too thrilled about exchanging farmland for a chunk of the desert. The other big issue involved in land swaps is that Israel insists on retaining a security cordon on a future Palestinian state's eastern border (the Jordanian border). This is a vital issue for both sides. Israel claims that they must have some presence on the Jordanian border to ensure that rockets and other threats don't enter the West Bank (much of which is within a few miles of Tel Aviv). For the Palestinians, not controlling their own borders is viewed as false sovereignty what is a state if it doesn't control its own borders? The point is, this over-simplified ""offer"" that doesn't contain any details isn't really a game-changer as it doesn't address the difficult issues involved in a land swap.

","Yes it is. Thanks for asking. ""Q&amp;A: Is Israel's naval blockade of Gaza legal?"" Reuters (6/2/10) Israel has said it will continue a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip despite growing global pressure to lift the siege after a navy raid on a Turkish ferry carrying aid killed nine activists this week. CAN ISRAEL IMPOSE A NAVAL BLOCKADE ON GAZA? Yes WHAT ARE INTERNATIONAL WATERS? A coastal state has a ""territorial sea"" of 12 nautical miles from its coast. There is a further 12 nautical mile zone called the ""contiguous zone"" over which a state may take action to protect itself or its laws. Under the law of a blockade, intercepting a vessel could apply globally so long as a ship is bound for a ""belligerent"" territory, legal experts say. CAN ISRAEL USE FORCE WHEN INTERCEPTING SHIPS? Yes. WAS ISRAEL'S RAID ""PIRACY"" No. Under international law it was considered a state action. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY SHIPPING DISRUPTIONS AFTER THE RAID? None so far. AND ""Helsinki Principles: Israel Was in the Right"" IsraelSeen (6/3/10) A perusal of The Helsinki Principles on the Law of Maritime Neutrality, a basis for international law on the subject, shows that Israel was well within its prescriptions in forcibly stopping the Gaza-bound flotilla. As Leslie Gelb, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations, writes, the blockade is not just perfectly rational, it is perfectly legal. Gaza under Hamas is a self-declared enemy of Israel — a declaration backed up by more than 4,000 rockets fired at Israeli civilian territory. Yet having pledged itself to unceasing belligerency, Hamas claims victimhood when Israel imposes a blockade to prevent Hamas from arming itself with still more rockets. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL ""Double Standard Watch: Israel's actions were entirely lawful, though probably unwise"", by Alan Dershowitz jpost.com (6/2/10) What Israel did was entirely consistent with international and domestic law. When Israel left Gaza, Hamas seized control and engaged in acts of war against Israel, including shooting nearly 10,000 anti-personnel rockets directed toward civilians. Israel responded by declaring a blockade, including a naval blockade, to assure that no rockets, or other war material, was permitted into Gaza. Israel allowed humanitarian aid through its checkpoints. Egypt also participated in the blockade. The legality of blockades as a response to acts of war is not subject to serious doubt. The second issue is whether it is lawful to enforce a legal blockade in international waters. If the offending ships have clearly made a firm determination to break the blockade, the blockade may be enforced before the ships cross the line into domestic waters.

","Notice how little attention this is getting compared to the old story. Of course this was going to happen. These are the same Libyans who produced a provisional Constitution which made even no mention of Sharia but then when Gaddafi fell, the first thing on their minds was getting Sharia back. They know how to play with the idiots over in the West perfectly. Of course the typical white Westerner is rejoicing in the freedom in the Middle East while ignoring all stories to the contrary such as this one. In their minds, the Islamic takeover of the Middle East is of no concern. It's what the people want of course. But faced with the villains over at the GOP who dare to go as far as banning same-sex marriage and abortions, they decry the dangers and the end of the world were they to take over. But the Islamic warlords who are taking over the Middle East, who violently kill and discriminate against anyone who isn't Islamic enough for them, that's not dangerous for them. After a few months on this site, I realized one thing. Although one would think that most people here are young liberal open-minded protectors of human rights; they are not. In fact, they have no clue about anything in the world and split it in two sides: exotic vs. traditional based on the American perspective which they foolishly apply to the rest of the world. For example, notice the attention Israel's human rights abuses against Palestine get here. But faced with the same abuses inflicted on Arab Christians such as in Iraq, where a massive exodus happened when Muslims either killed or forced them to leave their homeland, there is little attention or interest. Why? It doesn't fit the bill. In their views the real victims in the world are never Christians but they are the poor ""exotic"" Muslims. This goes even further, the concern and interest for young Liberals in the Middle East is nowhere to be found either. The grand sheikhs who stand against the these Liberals are new to them, exotic and interesting, not only that but they also oppose the Christian leaders that they loathe here in the US. The Liberal Middle Easterner who wants to bring rights and freedom to his people and bring to the 21-st century is not exotic and new enough for them.*tl:Dr Most of reddit are idiots who have no clue what human rights are.

56,"UK slips down global press freedom list due to Snowden leaks response | British government's draconian response to the Guardian's reporting sees UK drop five places on Freedom House list
","It's interesting that in the past the Guardian has denounced Freedom House as a sinister tool of US foreign policy helping western backed oppositions do 'soft coups' (sounds like a contradiction in terms) &gt; Freedom House is another of Soros's Open Society partners. It supports the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (Canvas), an organisation started by Serbians Ivan Marovic and Srdja Popovic. After playing a pivotal role in the CIA-backed deposing of Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic, the western media hailed Marovic as a democratic genius, but it came out later that his programme came out of an elite Boston thinktank's ""regime change"" manual, From Dictatorship to Democracy, written by Harvard professor Gene Sharp. Sharp's book is a bible of the colour revolutions – a ""regime change for dummies"". His Albert Einstein Institution has received funds from the National Endowment for Democracy and the Open Society Foundations, and his work serves as a template for western-backed opposition leaders in soft coups all around the world. Now suddenly all that is forgotten because it has criticized the UK and US governments. &gt; The United Kingdom registered both positive and negative trends in 2013, leading to a net decline from 21 to 23 points. A long-awaited reform of the libel laws raised the threshold for initiating cases and has the potential to curb “libel tourism.” However, a number of negative developments stemmed from the government’s response to the revelations of surveillance by the NSA and its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Authorities used the Terrorism Act to detain the partner of investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the story; raided the offices of the Guardian newspaper and destroyed hard drives containing potentially sensitive source materials; and subsequently threatened the Guardian with further action. In the wake of the 2011 News of the World phone-hacking scandal and the Leveson inquiry that followed, the establishment of a new regulatory body to oversee print media also raised concerns among some observers. Incidentally which is the only newspaper that supports the Leveson regulatory body? Yeah, the Guardian. Funny how they neglected to mention that Freedom House blames that for declining press freedom as much as it blames the governments actions over the Snowden material. &gt; Shortly after the publication of the report David Cameron made a statement to the House of Commons. Cameron welcomed many of Leveson's findings, but expressed ""serious concerns and misgivings"" regarding the prospect of implementing the changes with legislation. Ed Miliband, the Leader of the Opposition, called for full implementation of the report. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, and leader of the Liberal Democrats was unable to agree on a position with his coalition partner Cameron, so made his own statement, agreeing that changes in the law were necessary. In leaders the following day the Financial Times, the Daily Telegraph, The Independent, The Times, The Sun, the Daily Express, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Mail broadly agreed with Cameron's position, while The Guardian declared that Miliband has taken a ""principled position"", but that ""great care"" would be required for the legislation. It said Cameron ""who commissioned it and who has had very little time in which to study it, should think carefully before dismissing significant parts of it."" It added ""The press should treat it with respect – and not a little humility."" Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, which never signed up to the PCC, said he was in concurrence with a lot of Leveson's findings and the handling of the inquiry. However he disagreed with suggestions that those publications which did not voluntarily join up to the proposed self-regulatory body should be penalised by paying heavy costs and exemplary damages on potential libel actions, even if they won the case. Actually there was an element of theatre about the Guardian destroying 'hard drives'. Most of the destroyed kit in the picture is not a harddrive. It looks like they took an angle grinder to the contents of the junk box in the server room. Why did this happen? I think the government notified them under the Official Secrets Act which meant they could either return or destroy the information they had. Destroying a few obsolete computer parts was obviously the best option E.g. &gt; I’m interested in some of the precise language used by Rusbridger in these passages. He says the official demanded something – he did not make a request. And what was demanded was the return or destruction of material. Later, he uses the words handover or destruction. And of course it’s clear that the official threatens forcing the surrender of the material in court. &gt; &gt; This language makes me wonder whether the Guardian was facing an “official direction” for the return or disposal of the material under section 8(5) of the Official Secrets Act 1989. Destroying instead of returning protects their sources and it's also clear that they can still work on the material in their American office in the US it's illegal to leak classified information but it is not illegal for journalists to work on that information after it has been leaked. So has press freedom been affected? Not really they just need to pay for hotels in the US for journalists who want to work on material in the Snowden leaks. It doesn't mean they can't publish those stories in the UK. Incidentally the fact that the US is sheltering Guardian journalists from the UK government's Official Secrets Act is unlikely to change the Guardian's very anti US editorial line. &gt; I should make one thing clear. The reason that this has happened is not that the CIF clique are antisemites. Rather, they are America-haters, from the fine old British tradition with its roots in both upper middle class elites and the far Left. None of these people see themselves as Jew haters. They see themselves as progressives, at the vanguard of opposition to “imperialism” and injustice. They honestly believe themselves to be good people, doing important work. When they publish and promote people who want to kill Jews – even as they congratulate themselves for their opposition to “racism in a digital age” – it is because they think they’re socking it to the global hegemon. For those on the far Left, that is the USA: some of those they publish believe that it is Israel and the Jews who are pulling the strings of power. However, that’s no biggie. Seumas Milne supports them all, and gave them column space, for the same reason that he supported ”militants” in Iraq who killed British servicemen.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

","The Death of Moshe Yatom, the psychiatrist of Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. And what he had to say about The Prime Minister being insane! ""Moshe Yatom, a prominent Israeli psychiatrist who successfully cured the most extreme forms of mental illness throughout a distinguished career, was found dead at his home in Tel Aviv from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. A suicide note at his side explained that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been his patient for the last nine years, had “sucked the life right out of me.” “I can’t take it anymore,” wrote Yatom. “Robbery is redemption, apartheid is freedom, peace activists are terrorists, murder is self-defense, piracy is legality, Palestinians are Jordanians, annexation is liberation, there’s no end to his contradictions. Freud promised rationality would reign in the instinctual passions, but he never met Bibi Netanyahu. This guy would say Gandhi invented brass knuckles.” Psychiatrists are familiar with the human tendency to massage the truth to avoid confronting emotionally troubling material, but Yatom was apparently stunned at what he called the “waterfall of lies” gushing from his most illustrious patient. His personal diary details the steady disintegration of his once invincible personality under the barrage of self-serving rationalizations put forth by Netanyahu. Yatom grew increasingly depressed at his complete lack of progress in getting the Prime Minister to acknowledge reality, and he eventually suffered a series of strokes when attempting to grasp Netanyahu’s thinking, which he characterized in one diary entry as “a black hole of self-contradiction.” The first of Yatom’s strokes occurred when Netanyahu offered his opinion that the 911 attacks on Washington and New York “were good.” The second followed a session in which Netanyahu insisted that Iran and Nazi Germany were identical. And the third occurred after the Prime Minister declared Iran’s nuclear energy program was a “flying gas chamber,” and that all Jews everywhere “lived permanently in Auschwitz.” Yatom’s efforts to calm Netanyahu’s hysteria were extremely taxing emotionally and routinely ended in failure. “The alibi is always the same with him,” complained another diary entry. “The Jews are on the verge of annihilation at the hands of the racist goyim and the only way to save the day is to carry out one final massacre.” Yatom was apparently working on converting his diary into a book about the Netanyahu case. Several chapters of an unfinished manuscript, entitled “Psychotic On Steroids,” were found in his study. The excerpt below offers a rare glimpse at the inner workings of a Prime Minister’s mind, at the same time as it reveals the daunting challenge Yatom faced in seeking to guide it to rationality: Monday, March 8 “Bibi(Netanyahu) came by at three for his afternoon session. At four he refused to leave and claimed my house was actually his. Then he locked me in the basement overnight while he lavishly entertained his friends upstairs. When I tried to escape, he called me a terrorist and put me in shackles. I begged for mercy, but he said he could hardly grant it to someone who didn’t even exist.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,negative,1.0
59,"One of the largest protests in Jerusalem's history: White jews protesting the fact that they have to spend time in class with black jews. 
","Here is the real story: In a small town in Israel there was a semi-religious girls school and a community of Hasidim from the Slonim sect. The Hasidim wanted a school that encourages their values, and were unhappy with the pro-Zionist/apathetic religious views of the existing school. A compromise was made where the school was split into two curriculums, one run by the Hasidim and the other run separately, but both using the same building. As the demographics had it, most of the girls in the non-Hasidic school were of Sephardic, or Mediterranean, heritage and naturally, most of the other school was made up of Ashkenazis, or European Jews. Everyone got along just fine and nobody had any problems with the situation. Unitl... One day a fellow named Yoav Lalum came to town. He is a man with an organization whose sole purpose is to cause problems for Orthodox communities in Israel. He noticed the fact that there was a separate curriculae in the school and that it seemed racially divided. He brought the matter up to the Israel Supreme Court (Bet Din Hagadol) and they ruled that the division is racist and the school must be integrated. This angered the parents (both Ashkenaz and Sephard) who had children in the Hasidic part of the school, as it would mean that their children would be forced to accept a curriculum not up to their standards which includes, amongst other things, an apathetic view of religious observance and a focus on Zionism. 75 girls (about 50 Hasidic, 25 non-Hasidic Ashkenazis and 10 Sephardis) were removed from the school and a brand new school was started. The Ministry of Education refused to accredit the new school in order to put pressure on the parents. The parents refused to rejoin the old school and all 65 were sentenced to two weeks in prison. Naturally, a few big mouths who took some lessons in racism from the NAACP insist that this is a race issue, despite an overwhelming amount of support from the Ultra-Orthodox Sephardic community in Israel.

60,"Survey: Most Israeli Jews would support apartheid regime in Israel
","So let's see where to start... First the report was done for the New Israel Fund which we know is bankrolling the far left in Israel. Evidence is in the wikileaks. Second, the report — the lead story on Haaretz’s Tuesday front page — claimed that the survey proved that “Most Israeli Jews support an apartheid regime in the country, if the territories are annexed.” However, the nature of the questions, and discrepancies in the way the findings were presented, rendered some of the claims in the report hard to gauge. The survey, which asked over 500 Jewish adults questions devised by a panel of civil rights activists and academics, claimed to show that 39 percent of respondents believe there is a “slight” form of apartheid in Israel, and 19% said there was “heavy” apartheid. Thirty-one percent said apartheid was “not practiced” in Israel, and 11% “didn’t know.” This finding was summarized in a separate box on Haaretz’s front page as ostensibly proving that “58% believe that an apartheid rule already exists in Israel today.” The Haaretz article acknowledged that “the survey conductors say perhaps the term ‘apartheid’ was not clear enough to some interviewees. However, the interviewees did not object strongly to describing Israel’s character as ‘apartheid’ already today, without annexing the territories.” Third, within the secular public, who is the majority in Israel, 73% said they wouldn’t mind Arab students in their child’s school and 68% would live in an apartment building alongside Arabs. Given all of the above, the poll is wrong, the interpretation is atrocious and fits the bias of the people who payed for it and interpret it, I.e Haaretz",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

","Air (well all) security in Israel is entirely about shaking down Arabs. If you're white, they wave you though road checkpoints, something I both observed and was described to by locals. In airports, you show up 3 hours early and spend most of your time standing in long lines. show up late and they whisk you right past the checks so you can make your flight. It's all about making things seem secure and policed. I had all my stuff (including an iPad and laptop, both of which were scratched up by security) sent through a fancy bomb machine, then swabbed at length by another team, then was handed my stuff back and told to walk up to another terminal. Along the way I was freely able to enter and leave the ""secure"" area and could have easily swapped out my stuff with another person outside. Again, a huge fucking joke of security to make you feel nervous apparently. At the top, I was selected again for extreme search, where nothing on me was so much as frisked, but all my stuff was debagged and poked and swabbed with a high tech chemical sensor. Again, I'm a white American tourist. Apart from messing up all my stuff and wasting three hours for basically nothing more than a show of hyper-security, I got on my plane and left without incident. Going INTO Isreal was even easier: I just showed up and waited through a minor patdown line with no bomb scanners nor any bag search at all. WTF? Which is it? What it really boils down to is that Israel needs to sell bomb equipment, and that lobby is forcing America to buy its shit, so we can have the same high-tech display of fancy machines that Isreal uses on outbound flights, but that isn't always available in foreign airports going in! This isn't security, it's a combination of fascist show of authority combined with state sponsored technology sales. There is no proof of efficacy in any of this bomb equipment or how it is handled.

73,"Danish Bank wont invest in Israeli companies who's reportedly been involved in construction of Jewish settlements and the Apartheid Wall in the West Bank.
","Most Western countries can't say shit to the Israelis because it would be hypocritical. The imperialist European countries displaced and killed untold numbers when they expanded and colonized. The USA committed multiple cases of mass murder and oppression as well. Canada isn't too squeaky clean either but we try to make up for it by bloating the descendants with our tax dollars. If this Israeli-Palestinian conflict occurred at least 90-100 years ago, the Palestinian problem would've been dealt with in a few short years and we would currently be apathetic to it like we are about the other historic atrocities. However, because of the modern media, because of the progresses in human rights, the Israeli's cannot do what was historically done and that was to simply fuck shit up. Firstly, the ""it-belongs-to-the-natives"" argument is fucking stupid. For thousands of years it was perfectly ""acceptable"" to any native, situated in any part of the world, that if they are conquered then that's that. It is only a recent phenomena that expansionary/colonizing invasions are, for the most apart, illegal and condemned on a global stage. As for the ""Palestinian"" identity, the British were in control of Palestine, and in 1922 decided to turn it into a Jewish state. This slowly occurred leading up to the WW2. During the oppression of the Jews leading up to WW2, and the holocaust during WW2, hundreds of thousands of Jews immigrated or escaped to present-day Israel. Let's not forget that many former Allied countries turned away the fleeing Jews, and many of those Jews paid the ultimate price because of it. Also, I forget who but a very famous individual smuggled, I think, at least 80,000 Jews to Palestine who would have otherwise ended up in concentration camps. When the war ended and we had millions of displaced Jews whose homes had been ransacked, destroyed, or claimed by other parties, the Allies and UN decided it would be easier, or at least chose to, to allow them to go to Palestine; To join what was already becoming a heavily Jewish region. I suppose the British handed over their power to the Israeli's around this point, and so a few days later the neighboring countries invaded Israel. Of course they had every right to, especially since during all this time the Arab population never consented to the intrusion of the Jews or the creation of Israel, ever since 1920 when Britain's mandate to turn Palestine into a Jewish state went into affect. Even before the Arab-Israeli war the Palestinians revolted many times. But in the end, the British were the rulers in Palestine, and they allowed and participated in the settling of Jews onto the region. After the Arab-Israeli war, the Israelis won and conquered most of what remained of Palestine after the creation of Israel. It was later during the 6 day war that the new borders would be solidified. Now, up until this point, I'm actually going to side with Israel. Maybe someone would argue that the UN borders should be the extent of Israel, but Israel can never nor will ever or could have ever gone back to those borders, for any number of reasons... The main one being that the war didn't really end, and the Green Line was where Israel was fortified against any further aggression. Perhaps someone could give me a reasonable argument why I'm wrong. But given the circumstances I just don't see how the Allies would not have allowed the Jews to find a home of their own. Would it have been preferential if they decided to take a rather large empty barren of land like Manitoba or Saskatchewan? Certainly, but no country volunteered as far as I know and in the aftermath of WW2 the European map was altered. I suppose I don't see how the reforming of the Palestinian region is any different. What has happened since the 6 day war is a tragedy, and both sides can share the blame. Now since it is in the modern era, Israel can never hope to conquer what remains of Palestine without some serious international shitstorm. As for the overwhelming counterattacks made by the Israelis, well we can only sit back and admire the work of the Americans and their allies, who, after 9/11, have probably killed or maimed more people in Iraq and Afghanistan then the total population of Palestine. Counterattacks are accepted, at least in Afganistan, so are we going to deny that right to the Israelis? Eh, I don't think that's a very consistent position. Continuing on, the religious aspect that fuels ignorance and hatred for either side is a huge factor in the continuing conflict and it has largely stagnated any political progress to reach a resolution that will satisfy both sides enough to stop any aggressive behavior. Canada and their native population have worked out a non-aggressive solution to their problem, and while it does have problems of its own it certainly beats the helluva the situation in Palestine. As for some observable problems and workable solutions, the Israeli need to stop with the fucking settlements and checkpoints. It would be most advisable if they completely retracted all of it if they ever want peace. Both sides need to do their best and forget the past, especially the Palestinian population since most of them are Muslim and retribution and jihad is a big part of their religion, despite what any moderates say since they probably don't live in Palestine. Not to say the Jewish are squeaky clean either, but after WW2 they are no longer going to lie down and be fucked if they can do anything about it, no matter how ""ahead"" they are. Next, Israel needs to open the borders to the Palestinian people if the Palestinian people want to settle in Israel because the urban occupied areas are overpopulated and unsustainable. Lastly, the neighboring countries and rest of the extremist population in the middle eastern region, need to stop funneling the ignorance and means to retaliate to the Palestinian people. In conclusion, if both sides can stop seeking revenge on the other side for past events, which would be greatly helped out if Israel retracted their settlements, then perhaps this problem can be resolved. If I could look into the future and see this never happens, then I would advise Israel to just annex the rest of Palestine, grant citizenship to the Palestinian people, and get it over with. As far as what many Jews think, they will always be pro-Israel, for whatever convoluted reason, but most of them do not support the settlements or checkpoints, or at least don't realize the extent of the harm it causes. The settlers have an entirely different perspective on things for obvious reasons, hence this crazy article. For those in favor of the expulsion of Israel, or are, at least, pro-Palestinian, they need to start thinking long term and realize Israel is not going anywhere, and that they should focus on the settlements and a two-state solution, and to stop living in the past, which can only help to fuel the Muslim extremist's holy war. In the end, for there to be any change, Israel has to step up and be the driving force because it's not going to happen mutually or by the Palestinians.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,1.0

At the same time they are also saying, whatever happens it will be civil and diplomatic.&gt;OK the boats are heading to an Israel seaport now for sure. And the correspondents are discussing wtf will happen to the tonnes of supplies.&gt;The official response (in the form of a plan of action) is not being released yet because I think the government is still awaiting some confirmed information about the motives of the attack.&gt;Some official is emphasizing the boats had white flags, and the attack was on international waters.

We did everything we could to solve this using diplomacy. The convoy was not using humanitarian channels (I believe referring to using Red Cross to get the aid where it needs to go). If they had used these channels none of this would have happened. Us too want Gaza to receive the humanitarian aid it needs.

76,"Syrian rebels capture seven Iranians, including five members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Homs - where most civilian deaths have occured
","I do not like the source. The FSA attacked a tour bus of Iranian religious pilgrims in Syria and kidnapped 11 of them. Naturally the FSA is going to claim these pilgrims were military experts. These kidnappings give them leverage with Iran who is a backer of Syria. Remember the French cameraman, Gilles Jacquier, who was murdered by the FSA in a rally bombing. He died when the FSA attacked a pro-government rally in Homs. The government was trying to show that they still held control of Homs. The FSA shot two RPGs at the rally killing this French journalist and a number of civilians. The FSA has confessed to being the ones behind the attack and 'apologized' for the journalist's death. The Western media and Al Jazeera English still report to this day that the journalist died in a likely 'regime' attack or make it a point to leave it ambiguous to leave the impression it was the government that killed him. There is a huge amount of propaganda being used against Syria. The Arab Spring has been co-opted and is being suppressed by the West much like our pan-Arab uprisings a few decades ago that gave us these secular Western-backed dictators we are revolting against today. The West is intent on removing Assad for many reasons. The only forces capable of that inside Syria are the Islamists who have been biding their time and intensifying their hatred of the Assad family since their first uprising in 76-82. Now the West has let them loose like in Libya. And since their support of Saudi Arabia, the Sauds have had a free hand in spending their oil money on spreading their Wahabbi creed making that the sect-of-choice of today's fundamentalist throughout the world. The West is playing a dangerous game and are repeating the mistake of Afghanistan when they were fighting the Soviets except on the scale of the entire region rather than a small backwards mountain country many many miles away from the rest of us. More meddling for short-term gain that will lead to catastrophic consequence in the mid to long term. They are hoping to retool the Levant as a Turkish sphere of influence for the benefit of Israel. Turkey's relationship with Iraq and Syria have deteriorated recently due many reasons beyond this post that have hindered Turkey's ability to turn Eastward Syria because has greater influence than them. The facts are that those in support of the uprising are in the minority. The Guardian estimated 55% still support Assad. I think that number is much smaller than it truly is in real life. The minorities, secularists, and businessmen as well as anyone benefiting from the government (which is a lot as Ba'athism is a socialist party). The problem is that in the Arab mind, there can be no going back once blood is spilled. Assad will cling to power for another few years until his term as president is done. He will carry out the reforms that are already being pushed through which are exactly what the protesters were demanding before this became a civil war. I am still surprised Assad hasn't given into to his mother and been as ruthless as we know the Syrian military and intelligence can be. The fact he has not yet when practically everyone in the Old Guard of his father's government are yelling at him to show that he is a much better leader than we believed because he was never meant to be the successor to his father. He was hoped to be a reformer when he first came to power but then the Old Guard stifled him. I think now he has realized the reforms must go through despite all the pressure from within to send in tanks to level the cities. Homs is now in chaos. People are being kidnapped daily for ransom or to be tortured and executed. Americans cannot know the fear when riding a bus or walking down the street to the baker is a likely chance you will be murdered by gunfire or a car bomb, or taken and tortured in brutal ways for days before dying all because you are of the wrong sect to these people. Sunnis are killing Alawites. Alawites are killing Sunnis. There is no more government authority in Homs. In the Middle East when the central authority breaks down, people return back to their centuries old identities like sect and begin a power struggle of pointless killing all within the confines of a single city. The entire paradigm of central authority is different in the third world. This is what happens when our countries are meddled with and our central governments collapse due to this meddling. It is what happened in Lebanon and in Iraq. The Syrians are not stupid. They know of both examples and for this fear of civil war, the majority will always support Assad over these terrorists.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

81,"Juan Cole: Ahmadinejad and the Limits of American and Israeli Power
","As someone who has lived in Iran I would just like to voice my opinion. As much as Ahmadi likes to troll western countries by saying retarded shit like there are no gays in Tehran and sabre rattle against threats on Iran, as far as his domestic policies are concerned he is actually a good president. Let me elaborate a little. He has done a lot for poor people in the country, bringing water and electricity to many poor cities and villages who know one before him even cared to mention. Also past presidents in Iran (mainly Rafsanjani, who know is the face of the reform movement which is a laugh given his record) had strict laws against poor/homeless in Tehran and basically expelled them from the city. Ahmadi has actually welcomed them back and has set up many apartment projects in the city dedicated to subsidized housing for the poor. Furthermore he has actually fought against clerics to get the morality laws of Iran loosened, as in men can wear short sleeved shirts, women arent harrassed for having their hair showing, etc. I would also like to point out that those who are supposedly the leaders of the reform party in Iran (Khatami, Rafsanjani, Mousavi, etc.) all had their time in office and did absolutely nothing for the people in Iran. Under Rafsanjani if men wore short sleeves in the streets the police would douse their arms in paint as a scarlet letter. Under Khatami, he ordered many college newspapers shut down which led to protests that he countered by ordering the military to raid and kill the student dormatories. Now these pieces of shit are saying that they want the Iranian people to be free? please they just want to get their power back and make even more money. Rafsanjani is the richest man in Iran as he owns all the pistachio farms (Irans biggest export) and he wanted to privatize the oil companies and everything else that is nationalized. As it stands, gas is extremely cheap in Iran, you get a subsidy of a certain amount of gas each month for about 20cents a gallon and when you go over your limit it is about 60 cents. Rafsanjani wanted to privatize the gas industry, get rid of the subsidies, and jack the prices up so onlythe richest can afford to drive. So you can think from an outsiders point of view that Ahmadi is crazy as he says all these crazy things in the foriegn stage, but in Iran, trolling is a art, a fine one at that and even has its own word, 'herse'. Ahmadi just doesnt give a fuck because he knows no matter what he does countries like Israel and the US wont leave him alone, continue lumping Iran in with terrorists and keep on piling on sanctions, so he trolls. Hell just look back to after 9/11 when Iran offered to help the US track down al qaeda and bin laden, and bush slapped them in the face and placed them on the axis of evil. THis is just one of many instances in the recent past that Iran has held it's hand out only to be spit on by the western world. I am not saying that he is a good politician though, far from it, there are many areas he can improve upon, but he is not nearly as bad as outsiders make him out to be. One last point I would like to make is that I do feel that Israel and Iran should be allies and they would be good allies as they both have similar enemies in the many Arabic countries which are predominantly Sunni while Iran is Shiite. Personally I think religion is bullshit and the main reason I came over here is because I cannot stand theocratic countries. I wish that the Arabs never would have spread their filth into Iran and we could have remained a secular, progressive country so I would not have had to flee.

As far as I can see, I am the only person posting here who was actually there. So I can tell you that you are misrepresenting Mr. Meyer's views. Hajo Meyer is extremely proud of being Jewish (by culture and identity; he is not religious). But he strongly denies that Judaism and Zionism are one and the same. He sees Judaism as a cultural and religious tradition that is tolerant, accepting, and universalist. He sees Zionism, in contrast, as almost diametrically opposed to the tenets of modern Judaism; a political movement based loosely on religion, which is racist, colonialist, and abusive. He strongly objects to the hijacking of modern Judaism by the Zionist movement; he finds this offensive to himself as a Jew, and to the memory of those killed in the Holocaust, whose deaths are used to justify the violation of the Palestinian's human rights. &gt;Mr. Meyer didnotsay that the current mistreatment of the Palestinians is the same as the Holocaust. What hedidsay is that the current situation in Israel is very much like the situation in Germany during thelead upto the Holocaust, during the period between 1933 and 1941. During that period, Jews in Germany suffered deportations, propaganda designed to dehumanize them in the eyes of the Germans, different laws, arrest without warrant, and policies designed to impoverish them and limit their access to education. Current policies in Israel direct these same actions against the Palestinians. Mr. Meyer was in Germany while these policies were being implemented against his people, and therefore can recognize them when he sees them again, late in his life. &gt;Mr. Meyer was and is a man of incredible bravery, who escaped alone from Germany as a 14-year-old, in order to pursue the education he was denied as a Jew, then fought with the resistance against the Nazis, until he was betrayed, brought to Auschwitz, and interned there for 10 months until the place was liberated by the Russians. His message is, ""Never again,for anyone*."" He is courageous enough to withstand even the criticism of his own people, to stand up for the dignity and rights of every human, regardless of race or creed. &gt;Personally, I felt honored to meet him, and to hear him speak.

","One of the emotions that has a reliable physiological source in the brain is called ""affiliation"". (The others are risk-return, fairness, purity and respect for authority can't find the ref but AAAS Science a year ago.) Each is a dimension, with for example attractive pure things at one end and impure thinsg rejected at the other; acceptable risk here, unacceptable exposure there.) The authority dimension runs from respecting established sources of wisdom, even if you know them to be wrong (your Grandpa on behaviour on social media sites) to debunking anything that even vaguely tries to establish itself as an authority. Whilst these dimensions are active in all global societies, they are managed with very different emphasis in different cultures. The West tends to major on fairness and cost-benefit. It regards authority as something to debunk, and sees affiliation preference for and support of whatever group you think that is yours as something positively to crush: racism, nepotistical, bad. Purity that some foods, days of the week, kinds of people or practices are innately clean or impure hardly figures in policy thought. That is not so for much of the rest of the world. As the article says, not to support your affiliation group is regarded by much of the world as a social crime. Where we see nepotism and insider dealings, they see proper concern for and defence of the in-group. Add to this the near-universal fact of don-client networks, and you have a different way of organising a society. The nature of don-client(e) networks was first defined in Latin America, hence the name. However, they crop up in almost all low income societies. The networks consist of nested pyramids, such that anyone of any substance will have a group of ""clients"", people who regard them as their ""don"" (sheik / sirdah etc). This is a person who finds them work, supports them in adversity and generally looks after them. The clients stick together, often going through religious rites that confirm them as members of a group. They may pool their savings. The don will be a client of someone higher up the tree, who in turn... In many societies this goes up to president and down to the least influential. When the President changes, so too the sherrif and the dog catcher. Many societies still have remnants of this built into their institutions. Don-client networks build a certain brittleness into a society. If someone seems to lose ground, or lose face, their clients will desert them for someone more solid. Thus, you must never be seen to back down or waver: the roots of e.g. machismo. They also encourage indeed, demand corrupt practice. A don will be expected to rain presents and permissions on his clients, which means that he or she will need access to a ready supply of such goodies. Some of these are passed down from higher in the tree, some are simply stolen. People working in an organisation are acutely aware of whose ""string"" goes in which direction, and a board will consist of members who are more loyal to their pyramids than to the firm. If you run such a firm, you need to ensure that everything is nailed down; because if it is not, things vanish, contracts are placed with odd people, contract prices and the sums paid for them have little relationship to each other. This puts a huge emphasis on a peculiar sort of trust. You prefer to deal with someone who is proportionate in their demands, who shows flexibility, who is a keen as you to avoid going to law. Such people are thought to show a kind of honour, to respect others who are not of their in-group by not exploiting every advantage. It has been argued that the difficulties between the Arab and Israeli psychologies owe a lot to this difference. ""You treat them as men of honour"", an Arab said to me once, ""and they are immediately at your throat over petty details and stupid contracts that nobody expects to honour. So you take a step back, you expect them to remember themselves, and they do it again. So you stop treating them as men of honour.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

First off I know invading has been basically proven to be a mistake but thats not for here.

People have seen a dictator taken out and seen things START to improve. Yes Iraq has a long way to go but it is now the primary force with US backing (granted thats alot). REAL Elections. People in Iraq right now aren't protesting against their government like others. They're protesting against the same stuff we call for here. Corruption and high unemployment. Iraq has given others a peek at what can happen and in my opinion at least plays a small role in what is happening. Egypt may have been a US ""ally"" but it was an ally we bought for strategic reasons. And guess what we are probably going to support this military regime because right now the Middle East is our area of focus and we need anything we can get. Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia (probably another bought ally). The US took out probably the worst guy in the Middle East so I think people are now like we can do this.

","I wrote this 2 years ago: From 1976-82 in the same region there was a rebellion against the Assad rule. The Sunni Muslims brotherhood killed teachers in the secular schools hung police men and took over the town of Hama, close to Homs. I think this revolution is a continuance of this. The same region rose up first but now it had the added impetus of the Arabs spring and a wider membership.*the 1982 massacre that killed off the earlier rebellion*Assad got his Shiia units in the army ( alwinte, of the same sect ) to tear the heart out the Sunni rebellion by warning the city that anyone not surrendering to them would be killed and living up to that. 10,000 + killed is the low estimate. It is fair to think that this is the old wound reopening. Its in the same region with the same players, Sunni v Shiia piggy backing on the Arab spring.*So who would want Assad out?*Sunni Muslims. Being the majority demographic, Islamists. Assad is secular. in particular the pan Arabian Sunni tribes, Ougaidat, Baggara and Shammar but the city dweller of those tribe would be less anti Assad.*Who would now want Assad to remain.*Secularist Muslims who might fear the Islamists, educated females, business men, the elite et al. Sunni Muslims of the cities where tribalism is largely dormant. Shiia Muslim's, particularly Alwinties, who would be up shit street. A blood bath. Christians, they would be nervous of the Islamists.*Outside opinions*I think Israel would prefer Assad to remain. better the devil you know with an army he can't completely trust, excepting the Alwinte units, than a unified Islamist army. Any popular Arab state will have to incorporate hatred for Israel. Only dictators can get there state to sign peace accords with the pariah state. USA the West: same as Israel. They don't want another Islamist state but To knock out a Shiia controlled state would be a massive benefit. Largely speaking the USA allied with Sunni states, the Gulf states. The only challenge to US hegemonic control is the Shiia States, Iran, Iraq, (the US lost the Iraq war, witness Iraq allowing Iran to supply Assad across its territory) Syria, and Bahrain, ( Bahrain and Quatif region in Saudi is Shiia ) The Saudi Shiia sit on all the big oil fields. This is why the Saudi fear Iran, the suspect Iran could encourage the Saudi Shiia to rebel and the Sauds would lose control of the oil fields. Iran: They support Assad. a fellow Shiia, Gulf States: They support the rebels fellow Sunni. Russia: Assad, they have no love of Islamists. They need a client in the Middle East since the US and Israel booted them from Egypt. Syria fit the bill nicely. China: I don't think they care, Assad for stability but will deal with whoever takes over, they bring no baggage. Iraq: Sunni and Shiia hate each other, this would just add to the fun so according to their sect. The majority being Shiia in Iraq so by and large they support Assad. Iraq kurds. Rebels. A chance to expand their independence and territory into Syria. This adds a lot of background, The final Assad quote in interesting. A quote from R Fisk's history of the M.E. From a loyal Assad officer.""I know you disapprove of what happened at Hama, Robert, the killings and the executions,"" he said. ""But you must also realise that if our president had not crushed that uprising, Syria would have become like Algeria is today. We tried to talk to the Brothers at first, to negotiate with them. We didn't want this bloodbath. We asked them: 'What do you want?' They said: `The head of the president.' And, of course, that was the end. We were not going to have an Islamic fundamentalist state in Syria. You in the west should be grateful to us. We crushed Islamic fanaticism here. We are the only country in the Middle East to have totally suppressed fundamentalism.""Assad's own hatred of the Muslim Brother-hood comes through in a speech he made a month after the Hama bloodbath, his words now dutifully preserved in Hasna Askihita's computer memory in the Assad library under the date of 7 March 1982. Assad's comments are astonishing, even frightening, for he might well have been talking about Algeria ( or Afghanistan )today.""Nothing is more dangerous to Islam than distorting its meanings and concepts while you are posing as a Muslim. This is what the criminal Brothers are doing... They are killing in the name of Islam. They are butchering children, women and old people in the name of Islam. They are wiping out entire families in the name of Islam...

","There is so much in this blog to take issue with / offence from, but I'll just limit myself to one paragraph: &gt; Let's assume that when Israeli soldiers landed on the flagship of the Gaza flotilla, that it surrendered peacefully as the other ships had done. All of the headlines and reactions were based on Jihadists attacking the soldiers, taking them hostage, and Israeli forces killing nine of the violent attackers to rescue their people. No suicide attackers, no international impact. This doesn't indicate a turn toward non-violence but to carefully camouflaged violence. I can't see how the second sentence follows the first one. But after reading it a couple of times, I think I understand what he is trying to say. It might just read better if the order of the first two sentences were reversed. In any case, I think that this paragraph alone reveals a lot about the author's perspective and approach here. The use of the word ""Jihadists"" to describe the activists is particularly telling. I don't recall any of the media I read using that term to describe them. Also the Israeli Army narrative of the activists ""attacking the soldiers, taking them hostage, and Israeli forces killing nine of the violent attackers to rescue their people"" is presented without question, despite being contradicted by the testimony of the surviving activists and journalists on board. Whether this lack of rigour is evidence of bias or laziness, I don't know. I note that his blog requests donations to the ""American Friends of IDC"". I had to look that up.

128,"U.S. Tells Iran: We Won't Join Israeli Attack
","This guy on their facebook is a interesting read Yigal Gafni I am convinced that the Israeli threat to attack Iran is just a trial balloon, mainly for internal purposes. I have no doubt that Israel can effectively destroy 5-7 Iranian sites, at the most; Natanz, Parchin, Arak, the separation plant in Isfahan and two main MRBM bases, one south West of Tehran, the other, Imam Ali in Khoramabad. It can damage the site in Fordow with air power, and maybe it can be destroyed in a commando raid, in conjunction with an air assault. There is no way the reactor in Busher, under supervision by the Atomic Agency will be attacked, it is ""hot"" and bursting the copula will create a dirty bomb. The Attack will be a complete success and I bet all manned planes will return safe and sound to Israel. Dozens of UAV will neutralize air defenses, like in 1982 in Syria, and hundreds of special forces will assist with different tasks, from painting targets to eliminating AAA sites. Iran will not see the planes arriving or leaving, neither will be able to interfere with refueling or SAR missions. Tactical surprise will be absolute. The problem with this scenario? It can be done only once, this is a raid, not a campaign. The moment the planes will turn home, they will be painted by Saudi Radars, and while they will be allow to fly back to Israel, it will be with a severe warning that a second attempt will be blocked by force. The IAF cannot fight its way into Iran. So, this tactical victory will be worthless, since not enough damage can be caused by a single raid. The logic behind the raid is therefore faulted. Israel cannot go alone unless the goal is not really to terminate the Iranian nuclear program; for that you need the USAF with their B1 B2 bombers and the 24/7 all weather flying machines that only the US can produce, maintain and operate. The goal therefore is to drag Hezbollah into a preventive match before Iran can extend a nuclear umbrella. Israel hope that attacking Iran, with the benefit of delaying the program, will force Hezbollah into a over reaction, for example, firing dozens or hundreds of missiles south of the Haifa Afula line, where the vast majority of Israelis live. This will convince even the most peace loving Israelis to don fatigues and march north in earnest. A general reserves call up will allow Israel to invade Lebanon with 6-7 divisions, 3 of regular army, in top fighting shape, the rest, as backup and mop up operations, and drive a 3-4 prong incursion into Lebanon, one on the Coast, towards Beirut, One from Metula, North to the Shuf and the Bekaa Valley and one though the Shia Iron Triangle, the Shuf, and converge in Beirut with the coastal front, destroying the Shia strongholds and depots, driving toward Dahanie, in South Beirut, the Hezbollah capital. The fourth will be a combined Air and Seaborne assault on the area of the Beirut Airport. 5-6 days will convert Lebanon into a pile of rubble and Hezbollah into a legend in martyrdom, but they will be done for, at least in theory. If Hamas or the Salafist will fire into the Israeli rear, Beer Sheva or the other Air force bases, and they know where they are, 3 more divisions will invade Gaza as well. Syria, now in turmoil, will not be able to intervene, no Sultan Yaakov this time around. Egypt will cry faul, cancel the peace treaty but will not intervene since It will mean loosing their army and the American dollars. This is what is really at stake here. The IDF and Intelligence positions are very clear, this plan is madness, we have tried this before and we failed. The failure to anticipate an American veto (by G.W. Bush) on the destruction of Lebanon, in 2006 is what forced the IDF to change plans and move for a smaller invasion that did not served any purpose, and the embarrassment of having 35.000 IDF soldiers being kept at bay by less than 2.000 well trained guerrilla fighters. I believe the American government, regardless of whom will be the next president, will not, I repeat, endorse the wholesale destruction of Lebanon, in a quest to hurt Hezbollah. In an absence of a clear purpose and strategic goal, not to mention, strategic coordination with the US, this plan should be shelved or converted into a video game. US Government decision to publicly distance himself from the deadly duo, kneecapping their megalomaniac fantasies is 100% correct. The US can only loose from being dragged, or willing fully participating in this nonsense. If the US ever have to go to war with Iran, it should be about American, not Israeli interests, do it alone, or in a coalition that will exclude the IDF, like in 1991.

131,"270 Palestinians kids -under the age of 18, are currently held in Israeli prisons 
","This article on its own, doesn't mean much. The fact that ""270"" Palestinians who are under the age of 18 are in prison, doesn't say why, for how long, or their respective ages. If most are 16-17 (which is a very reasonable assumption) then that statistic likely pales in comparison to that of most other countries, even industrialized ones. Additionally, even assuming there are those younger, we can probably assume they did ""something"", or at least that most did. And when someone does ""something"", in any country that has law enforcement, the offending person is put in jail, regardless of age (exceptions do exist for those who are very young e.g. 4) that's the way the world works. Also, the article doesn't make the distinction between a jail for adults, and a juvenile facility. For all we know, all the 270 ""kids"" are being held in a juvenile facility, which again, is not weird at all. Last but not least, if what bothers you is that Palestinians are being held in a Israeli prison, given the climate between Israel and Palestine, it's not as if extrication would be an appropriate solution in most cases. The bottom line being, the information given regarding 270 people under the age of 18 being jailed, is not near enough for any amount of outrage about their captivity. There may be reasons to become outraged regarding some of the people who are in prison e.g. the fact that people are being held without trial is NOT ok, but that seems to be the only part that is worth any attention. Edit: After re-reading the article, the administrative detention ought to be explained a bit more, while it is possible that this is something to angry about, it is also worth noting that the length of time is extraordinarily important here.

Through their ownership of various media, such as television, radio, magazines, newspapers, book publishing and entertainment, these Zionist organizations never fail to demonize their perceived enemies while pretending to be the world’s watchdogs for international ""terrorism."" At the same time, the state-sponsored terrorism of the Israeli State is never mentioned by this ""free"" press. This one-sided perspective concerning the politics of the Israeli State is an outrage.

141,"Queen Elizabeth lacks all decency and invites Bahrani ruler, who massacred pro-democracy protesters, for lunch.
","She did this at the instruction of the UK Government the decision was not hers. And it is frankly naive to expect the UK Government to be concerned about 'pro-democracy protesters' (aka Shia fundamentalists) in the Middle East. Basically if there's a revolution against a hostile regime the UK just like the US will back it in the hope it will install a friendly regime. If there's a revolution against a friendly regime (and the US has an important base there, so Bahrain can't get any more pro-US) the UK will not. And none of these revolutions are about 'democracy'. The one in Bahrain was about switching a Sunni theocracy to a Shia one. IMO the UK and the US should spout loads of rhetoric about how they promote democracy. But when it comes down to who gets a military intervention to help the rebels kill them (Gadaffi, Assad) and who gets invited to have tea with the Queen, more basic considerations like our national interests and those of our allies should be used to decide. Cynical realism should decide our foreign policy, not some sort of neocon 'democracy projection' strategy. As Richard Armitage put it about Hezbollah &gt; ""Hezbollah maybe the 'A team' of terrorists, maybe al-Qaeda is actually the 'B team',"" Armitage told a conference on the impact the September 11 attacks had on US foreign policy. &gt; &gt; ""They're on the list, they're time will come, there's is no question about it,"" he said of Hezbollah which is backed by Iran and Syria and virulently anti-Israel. &gt; &gt; ""They have a blood debt to us and ... we're not going to forget it,"" Armitage said, referring to numerous anti-US attacks the group has claimed. The US shouldn't support the rebels in Syria because of 'democracy'. It should be doing it because Syria is the supplier and protector of its enemy, Hezbollah. Similarly it should oppose the rebels in Bahrain because they are backed by Iran and Syria. Though this is not in any sense a preference for Sunni Islam over Shia Islam. Al Quaeda is Sunni and an arch enemy of the US. The current Iraq government is Shia and more or less an ally.

","What a politically-used survey... Let me help you understand why this is bullshit: The immigrants say that they are refugees, the governments says they just came for work. The reality is that some of them are refugees, and some of them came for work. The problem is that the government refuses to look whether they are actual refugees or not, they just throw them in the poor neighborhoods of Tel Aviv where they inevitably turn into crime. In other words, the problem is the lack of an immigration policy. The interior minister himself (Eli Yishai), who is the one that should be actually dealing with it, chooses to blame the Africans and by that, he is making every person who thinks they should be deported look like a xenophobic racist bigot. Now, here comes the survey guy, and asks ""Do you think the African refugees should be deported?"". Most of these kids don't even know what ""refugee"" means. I mean, yes, they should know it, but the reality is that there is confusion in Israel about what refugees actually are.

145,"Why Is The Muslim World So Easily Offended?
","I would state that the reason the ""Muslim World"" is so easily offended is because the western world is more than naturally inclined to come in and say: ""Gee Golly Willickers! Those Muslims sure are hornery!"" As has been mentioned many times before, the folks that are protesting have histories of repression, lack of education, etc. in countries that have had histories of repression, lack of education, etc. The problem stems from the notion that this somehow represents all Muslims and the ENTIRE Muslim world. The very fact that we are so willing to make the generalization of ""Muslims are like this"" or ""Why do Muslims do that"" means that we will never find a solution because we've forced the problem to be so vast that such a task is impossible. No one asks: ""Why are there X many thousands in Egypt (as oppose to X MILLION) protesting?"" Then you can look to the demographic of those protesters, the locations, the targets of the protests, and hone in on the causes. Maybe the protests are larger indicators of a general dissatisfaction with the respect of Islam in the west, but that could very well be moot if the protests were organized by a hardline, anti-west (note, I didn't say Islamic Extremists) organization. Then, with these questions and their answers, a solution that solves problems IN THAT REGION can be formulated. Also, folks need to ask: ""If there are protests in Germany, Australia, and 'Western Civlization' countries why are they really protesting and what could possibly satisfy them?"" Potentially asking them what could slake their thirst for yelling would force them to voice their solution and, well, if they say things like ""Make Islam the STATE RELIGION!"" Then they know their cause is lost because the people in these countries know enough to know that this position is indefensible and they will end up being ignored. Lumping these thousands of protesters together just because their ""Muslim"" belies the notion that Muslims in other countries, in the SAME countries, may just not give a flying hoot because they've got other things to do with their lives. Do you see protests in the Balkans? Malaysia and Indonesia? Do you see American-Muslims storming the embassies here? NO? Well then, ""THE MUSLIM WORLD"" is not what you mean. It's the ""Arab World"". No, not even that.

Oh my......so many caveats to that question. Notice how it doesn't focus on protests in western countries because those people obviously won't start breaking down their home country.

The Mission has also spoken with them and notes that their accounts are consistent with the testimony provided by the witnesses it heard. &gt;&gt;.837. There has been no suggestion that the al-Maqadmah mosque was being used at that time to launch rockets, store weapons or shelter combatants.[464 See, for example, statements made by Israel in ""The operation in Gaza..."", para. 234.] Since it does not appear from the testimonies of the incident or the inspection of the site that any other damage was done in the area at that time, the Mission concludes that what occurred was an isolated strike and not in connection with an ongoing battle or exchange of fire. &gt;.4.

","Look, let us play a hypothetical here... (fan fiction) ""Why is the Western World so Easily Offended?"" (in an alternate universe) after half a century of middle eastern occupation and conflict regions throughout the united states and canada our foundations and borders have been shredded by distrust, hatred, and resentment, while education and health care have deteriorated and life expectancies have all but evaporated at the hands of continuel warfare over our precious natural resources, for profit. This has divided the great United States of America into a continent of lineages and five distinct regions populated by religious extremists and their wealthy energy barron business friends and the arms dealers playing neutral supplying both sides. At one point the west has enough and bands of vigilantes riot and form uprisings to show their distaste for their lifestyle of living in regions where gun shots and bombings are natural occurrences, more common than natural disasters, and enemy military occfupation and wide spread warfare has been going on for at least three generations in modern history on all borders. The people of the west begin to feel that their 'liberties' have been deteriorating and in a futile, last ditch unorganized effort violently rebel. To make noise, to be heard, to negotiate demands and wants and needs... (Making matters worse. Translation and communication barriers) The factions and allegiances are lost at this point, the rebels and extremists are fighting out of desperation, but they are fighting for personal gains, and the vigilantes have agendas of their own. The Middle East (in this hypothetical timeline, the dominent power pressing on the wests liberties and freedoms) own the majority of the global news outlets and media companies, their people have been living comfortably, in a far away region, secluded and isolated from the conflict, with misconceptions about the west, and are dumb founded when the west retaliates, they toss it up to 'religion.' and so it goes down all the media feeds and into the minds of the middle east, the west is easily offended because all the east was trying to do was assimilate them into their own 'super awesome culture...' where they bring yogurt drinks, kabobs, and shwarmas (McDonalds and Yum! Corp. are not too happy here because they lost market share to the better tasting food)... A super awesome culture which has grown stagnant, in their own region because they are over extended due to generations of military industrial rulership and global police expansionism. Now they themselves face a police state rulership, deteriorating government doctrines and increase in censorship and losses in freedoms, with a down economy, lack of health care, education cuts, unemployment, but their standard of living has remained constant, because well they have not had to deal with the damage both physical and psychological factors of warfare in their own land. With the exception of the occasional isolated 'crazy man goes insane on a shooting spree killing many' or 'the western rebels stage a futile terrorist attack, enticing even more violent retaliations.' Perspective: both parties never truly understand one another, and we are left to ask, 'why is the freedom of a religious world so easily offended.' (this is asking the wrong question) Honestly, it's a cultural thing, you shake up any culture, you're going to have whiplash, because well they might have liked their own culture better than the one you bring/promise. The regions in the middle east have been suffering from internal turmoil for generations, and then you have the west come in and shake things up with half a century of warfare post the creation of Israel in a predominately Islamic region. (ski instructor says you're gonna have a bad time.) Is this really a surprise, it's been building up and now it's in the boiler room.

149,"Head of U.N. Panel Regrets Saying Israel Intentionally Killed Gazans
","This is hardly a retraction, and it's been blown out of proportion by Israel's supporters. The primary crimes exposed by the Goldstone report were the deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, the use of chemical weapons (white phosphorus) on civilians, in addition to other documented attrocities (the use of Palestinians as human shields, the deliberate killing of civilian police officers, etc). Furthermore most of what Goldstone has said can be contested. The claim that Israel ""intentionally targeted civilians"" in regards to the Goldstone report was based heavily on a particular incident where civilians were sheparded into a home that was subsequently bombed by Israeli forces, killing the members inside. Israel has responded by claiming that the bomber was unaware of the civilian presence within the building, and is currently holding an investigation. In Goldstone's mind this exonerates Israel and proves that the intentional targeting of civilians wasn't a military doctrine, but there are conflicting reports on the nature of the investigation, how it's being conducted, etc. So to say the least, what Goldstone has said here isn't the final word on that particular incident. Finally, a comment I found attached to the WaPo article that I believe everyone here can appreciate. &gt;There is intentionality, and then there is intentionality. Israeland the US, for that mattermay not intentionally ""target"" civilians. What they do indisputably do is operate militarily according to doctrines of massive retaliation and violent preemption. And operations conducted according to these doctrines produce civilian casualties that, despite claimed ""intentions,"" vastly exceed the level of civilians killed ""intentionally"" by their terrorist enemies. &gt;Decades of experience in warfare of this type shows that this is inevitably the case. Therefore, to argue that the civilian casualties inflicted by Israel and the United States are ""unintentional,"" and somehow less culpable than those inflicted by terrorists, is pure sophistry.

' We believe in equality for women. We believe in tolerance of each other’s religious beliefs and in an open campus. ' ... ' ... It seems to me that the State of Israel has all the values we just outlined. It is surrounded by 22 Arab states occupying 99 and a half percent of the land in the Middle East and these states do not share these values. Israel, which occupies less than half of one percent, does share these values. ' ... ' ... about six years ago [I] became a member of the Middle East North Africa Advisory Committee because I had become concerned about what had appeared to me to be questionable attacks on the State of Israel. ... ' ... ' After five years of attending the Middle East Advisory Committee meetings, seeing the one board member who shared my views leave the organization, another supporter on the Middle East Advisory Committee who had joined at my request being summarily dismissed, and having great doubts about not only the shift in focus to war issues but also the way they were being reported, I wrote an op-ed in The New York Times questioning these policies. To me, the most important point in my op-ed was the following: “They (Human Rights Watch) know that more and better arms are flowing into Gaza and Lebanon and are poised to strike again. And they know that this militancy continues to deprive Palestinians of any chance for the peaceful and productive life they deserve. Yet, Israel, the repeated victim of aggression, faces the brunt of Human Rights Watch’s criticism.” ' A Human Rights Watch Board member told The New Republic that they go after Israel because it is like “low-hanging fruit.” By that, I think he means that they have a lot of information fed to them by Israel’s own human rights organizations and the press, that they have easy access to Israel to hold their press conferences, and that the press is eager to accept their reports. ' ... ' When I was in Israel [in October, 2010], I went to the Gaza border and I learned that since the beginning of 2010, more than 11,000 patients with their escorts exited the Gaza Strip for medical treatment in Israel. ... I was told the Israelis make the Palestinians change cars at the border because cars had been rigged to explode. A woman on crutches was changing cars. She fell down. Three Israeli soldiers ran to help her get up. She blew herself up, killing the four of them. The Hamas government is preaching genocide of Israel, yet Israel is treating Gaza’s sick. ' ... ' Human Rights Watch’s mandate states that they do not take a position on war, and they are very proud of this. They continually point out that they are not an anti-war group. Iran and its proxies, Hizbullah and Hamas are preaching genocide, not only of Israel but of all Jews everywhere. Genocide is one of the greatest human rights violations, and the Genocide Convention states it must be acted upon when it is first threatened. ' I believe that Human Rights Watch’s position is that their mandate to not take sides in a war takes precedence over the Genocide Convention at this time. It is fair to ask, “Why?” The reason they give for not taking sides on a war is that it is their responsibility to protect civilians on both sides during a war. Not before the war, and not after the war, but during the war. How can they protect Israeli civilians during a war when the opposition’s aim is genocide and when Hamas states that there are no civilians since all Israeli Jews serve in the military? How can they protect Palestinians when their armies are not uniformed, hide their arms among the civilian population and in public buildings, and shoot from heavily populated areas? ... ' ... ' ... On Thursday, November 4, a report came out that Fathi Hamad, the Hamas administration’s Interior Minister, revealed that as many as 700 Hamas military-security operatives were killed during Operation Cast Lead. The number, consistent with Israel’s examination, is significantly higher than the numbers given by Hamas and used by the Goldstone Report. It would indicate that about 60 percent of those killed in the war were actively engaged and not civilians – despite Hamas’s tactic of embedding itself in the civilian population of Gaza. ... ' ... Yoram Peri, in his book, Generals in the Cabinet Room, says that over 90 percent of the people killed in war starting after World War II – which is when non-uniformed armies started to appear – have been civilians and that there have been over 28 million people killed. Only with democratic armies – like the U.S., NATO, and Israel – are the facts very clearly different. In Gaza, if the new report about Hamas is verified, at most there was one civilian killed for every two Hamas fighters. ' ... ' Reports from military experts like Colonel Richard Kemp, who led British forces in Afghanistan, and Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, claim that the Israeli Army performed admirably in Gaza and added that they have done nothing different than the U.S. and NATO forces facing the same problems in trying to avoid civilian death. ' ... ' ... the statistics show that civilian death by democratic uniformed armies are much, much, much lower than the 9 out of 10 civilian deaths in general conflicts. ... ' ... ' I am going to bring up the right of return only briefly because it is so complicated. The right of return is endorsed by Human Rights Watch and other human rights organizations – unless I have missed something. ' They realize that there is not going to be a return of people, but that there will be compensation and that the right must be recognized. To me, it is the same philosophy that leads them to not taking sides in a war – the theory that one mandate decision is suitable for all occasions. I believe that the Arab decision to keep refugees in labor camps for 60 years along with the UN decision to have a different definition of refugee of Palestinians has made a mockery of what was intended. ' The right of return for all refugees is defined as being only for the people who actually left their country. However, the definition of a Palestinian refugee is different. It is for those who left Israel, their children born in exile, and for all of their heirs. ' Thus, while in every other case in the world, the refugee numbers go down over time, the number of Palestinian refugees has gone up. The original 600,000 is now up to 4 million worldwide, all claiming the right of return. ... ' ... Another factor that has not been dealt with is that the 800,000 Jews who left Arab countries and went to Israel immediately received citizenship and while they do not want a right of return, it is reported that they left over twice the amount of worldly goods in the Arab countries than the Arabs leaving Israel. What, if any, adjustments should be made to recognize this? All such movements of population are both sad and difficult when they are made necessary by intolerance and hate. But, actually, the world has tried desperately to do its part by paying the substantial costs of the refugee camps for over 60 years – reportedly over $13 billion with perhaps a quarter of it paid by the U.S. and little paid by the Arab countries. ' ... ' The last point that human rights organizations, it seems to me, have avoided, and where they could be very helpful, whether it is in their mandate or not, is to start talking about what kind of second state is going to be next to Israel. ... ' ... ' ... Natan Sharansky came to my hotel and gave me an autographed copy of his latest book Defending Identity. In it, he has some very harsh words concerning human rights organizations. ' Having spent nine years in Soviet prisons, he has a very clear picture of the difference between free and totalitarian nations. ' Here are a few sentences from his book: “The hypocrisy and double standards of the international human rights organizations reflect the disappearance of clear moral criteria that alone can guard human rights. A refusal to see the difference between free and totalitarian societies, between a state at peace and a state at war against terrorist regimes, undermines the universal values on which a claim to human rights is based.” ' He adds: “A commitment to human rights is above all a commitment to democracy and freedom and to the right to defend them. To equate all cultures, to refuse to distinguish between those that are democratic and those that are not, is the profoundest betrayal of human rights. . . It is acceptable to hold democracies up to a higher standard as long as you recognize that democracies, by definition, are already maintaining higher standards.” ' And he also says: “In its refusal to distinguish democratic from nondemocratic regimes, the human rights movement undercuts its own commitment to democratic freedoms and itself becomes a tool of undemocratic powers.” ' ... ' As for Gaza, it is certainly appropriate in Nebraska to quote Warren Buffet. In fact, getting to the end of a speech without mentioning him I consider extraordinary. One of his clear, direct, concise statements could apply to Gaza: “You can’t make a good deal with bad people.” However, if the West Bank starts to compete with Israel in building rather than destroying, they will have better lives for themselves, and to their surprise, they will have the free world, including Israel, helping them.

","Man, I hate being that guy. The government and military of Israel screw up all the time, but not in this case. Here's what happened.

The blockade of the Palestinian territories is clearly legal whether Gaza and the West Bankarestates, each of which have governments that have pledged ""eternal war"" against Israel thus rendering themselves blockadable, or are not states, in which case Israel was defending its own territory from a stated intent to violate its sovereignty ( So arguments that the blockade itself is illegal are wrong. And to be clear, illegal weapons, explosives, and the types of construction supplies Hamas usually appropriates for building bunkers were all over the ship ( So we know that the crew of the ship were intending to enact violence on the way but of course, if anyone knew anything about the leaders of the crew, who had spent months prepping their fellow passengers for ""martyrdom,"" this wouldn't even be an argument ( It is sick enough that Shahid brought his child along, hoping he would be ""martyred"" as well. So we know the ship was populated by suicide terrorists carrying explosives and IEDs, refuting any argument about their peaceful intentions. And surely even the most ardently religious anti-Israel zealot has seen the footage of what actually happened during the boarding. Suicide martyrs charged the soldiers wielding slings and machetes, stole one of their weapons and began firing. The stolen weapon was a pistol, which was armed with actual bullets the primary weapons of the IDF soldiers only had rubber bullets and beanbag bullets, to avoid the types of casualties the crew of the Mavi Marmara explicitly stated it wanted to cause. And of course, it was part of their intent to take the boarding force hostage as well ( for example just click around).

","As a 'western' person living in England, my feeling is that perhaps us westerners should just stop having opinions about Islamic/arabic cultures. This isn't a fully formed idea so if anyone reads my post and comments I will take on board any criticisms etc. I know it's probably too long, fuck me right. Here goes: 1) Most of what westerners know about islamic/arabic life is filtered through western corporate media. 2) Media savvy people (e.g. redditors) should know by now that the media is often putting out info that's shaped by various forces (PR firms, advertisers etc) often with cynical intentions ('buy this' etc) 3) We know that even in the recent past, the media has been involved in shaping public ideas around subjects which also happen to be important points on our respective governments' agenda (e.g. pre Iraq war lies about WMDs etc in the UK at least) 4) We know that various parts of our society have an axe to grind. Blah blah blah geo-political strategy. energy security etc etc blah blah blah 5) For the past 70 years or so the west has been doing some really dreadful things in the middle east (propping up totalitarian regimes, organising coup de etats against democratically elected governments etc). And the west isn't done yet ('Hello Iran!') 6) Hopefully we can put aside any far left conspiracy theory thoughts (just to keep things simple) and still acknowledge that the above points are true. 7) We westerners have a terrible track record in the middle east and very iffy moral high ground (if any). 8) (So my impression is) a lot of people living in Islamic/arab states have negative feelings about the West (UK, US especially) because our governments keep doing awful things to them and their families (drone strikes in Pakistan, possible 1 million Iraqi civillian casualties from Iraq war, support for Israel etc) 9) It seems unlikely that we as westerners can really unpick the complex mass of cultural/political/philosophical factors at play in the current relationship between western and middle-eastern cultures particularly given our collective past.

","Zionism is a movement started by a number of European Jews in the 1890's who claimed Palestine as their homeland due to historical biblical ties. Out of a population of 1,000,000 people in Palestine in 1897 only 5% or 50,000 were Jewish. Those few Jews in Palestine reacted negatively to Zionism. They neither saw the need for a Jewish state in Palestine, not did they want to exacerbate relations with the Palestinian Arabs. At this time in the Holy Land, religions lived together in relative harmony, a harmony only disrupted when the Zionists began to claim that Palestine was the rightful possession of the Jewish people to the exclusion of its Muslim and Christian inhabitants. In 1914 the Zionists had 127,000 dues paying members world-wide and had been trying to push the Jewish people to Palestine since 1890 The didn't want to go, In world war 1 the Jews were told to go to Palestine and only 25,000 actually went. In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany, and in 1935 the Nuremberg Laws made German Jews and later Austrian and Czech Jews stateless refugees. Similar rules were applied by the many Nazi allies in Europe. In 1935 as a result 60,000 Jews moved into Palestine. This was not enough as the Zionists wanted millions to move there, but of course just like WW1 no one wanted to leave the green pastures of Europe to go to the desert, a final solution was created, either go to Israel as the Zionists wanted or be persecuted and exterminated by the Nazis who were funded by the Zionists Rothschild's league of bankers. The Jews had a choice, move to Israel or get persecuted History as written always goes to the winner and the globalists back then and the MSM haven't actually told the truth about Hitler's roll in WW2 on behalf of the globalists. We hear a lot about the Jewish holocaust but not much on the fact the Zionists funded and controlled/owned Hitler and his agenda. &gt; As soon as the Nazis assumed power in 1933, the Zionists gained a visibly protected political status. After the Reichstag fire, the Nazis crushed virtually all political opposition and closed 600 newspapers. But not the Zionists nor their newspaper which was hawked from every street corner, and saw its circulation multiply five times to 38,000. Zionism was ""the only separate political philosophy sanctioned by the Third Reich."" The Zionist uniform was the only non-Nazi uniform allowed in Germany. Same with their flag. Hebrew was mandated in Jewish schools. Still German Jews wanted to stay in Germany ""even as second class citizens, even reviled and persecuted."" But the Zionists scorned the German Jews saying they deserved to be persecuted for wanting to assimilate. Then came the Zionist funded holocaust There is the truth and the older generations can vouch for it in Germany, little bit different than what the main stream dissemination (media) will ever tell you, but none the less the truth After WW2 the Nazis were moved to the united states under operation paper-clip and america became the new foreign military corporation for the Rothschild league of bankers and the Zionists new dog.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,1.0

353,"Israel's Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans Palestinians who marry Israeli Arabs from obtaining Israeli citizenship or even residency rights.
","I'm very hard on Israel—extremely so. (You can check my comment history to verify.) But I have to reluctantly say that there are factors to be considered. The difference between Nazi Germany and Israel [on the question of inter-marriage] is two-fold: 1) Jews never exceeded more than 500,000 people in Germany. And that was at their height. (Compared to 80 million Germans, Jews were never a demographic threat.) Whereas Palestinians are set to outnumber Jews (and by several orders of magnitude in upcoming decades). 2) German ethnicity is a lot more rock-solid than the Israeli identity. In other words, the German people were united by thousands of years of common blood, common language, common soil, etc. Jews—for all their propaganda to the contrary—are more of a religion than a ""race"". You have Sephardic Jews (who have North African DNA haplogroups [like E3b]) which accords with historical records of Berbers converting to the religion of Judaism in the 6th Century. In other words, they wereneverfrom Palestine to begin with. Then you have Ashkenazic Jews, with genetic markers from Iranids, Slavs, Khazars, Ossetians, Arabs, etc. Add to this Ethiopians, who claim they're secretly Jewish, too (but who in genetic testing turn out to be indistinguishable from other Africans from their region). So while Germans had common blood, common language, common soil . . . people identifying as Jews can be black, white, brown, yellow and have massively different genetic origins. As for common language-Which language can we mention for Jews? Yiddish? Ladino? Hebrew? Did Ethiopian Jews have anything in common with Polish Jews linguistically? Nope. Did Afghan Jews speak the same language as Spanish Jews? Nope. And how about all the Arabic-speaking Jews, from Moses Maimonides in Spain to all the Mizrahim in Iraq and Syria? So there goes any claims to a ""common language"". And as for common soil-Jews are famously internationalist. They're a ""rootless people"". Wanderers. My point in this rant: modern Jews are held together by one thing: a religion. A culture. . . . But the concept of a ""Jewish race"" is extremely problematic. Far more so than Germany's conception of itself as an ethnic group. So Israel is on far weaker ground than Germany ever was. Germans = in Europe for 50,000 years. Israelis = In a country younger than Paul Newman. Germans = actually from a common genetic stock. Israelis = composed of dozens of different ethnic groups and races, held together by the myth of a common origin (which, when you scratch the surface, falls apart like wet toilet paper). So do my democratic instincts revolt at Israel's behavior? Of course. But I can see why they're so much more antsy, so much more paranoid. Their numbers are extremely small. Intermarriage might very well extinguish them—which was not even remotely true with Germany. (So, on balance, Germany was far more irrational in their ""racial concerns"" than Israel is.)",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

I was clear in July, and what I said in July has followed me all over the world by the American and Israeli propaganda machine, so I want to be very clear again. All dignified people in the world, whether Arabs or Muslims or others with dignity, are very proud of the speech made by President Bashar Al-Assad a few days ago here in Damascus. &gt; &gt; For me he is the last Arab ruler, and Syria is the last Arab country. It is the fortress of the remaining dignity of the Arabs, and that’s why I’m proud to be here and addressing you this evening. &gt; ….. &gt; The reason why Syria is being threatened is not because of anything bad which she did, but because of the good which she is doing. &gt; ….. &gt; So I say to you, citizens of the last Arab country, this is a time for courage, for unity, for wisdom, for determination, to face these enemies with the dignity your president has shown, and I believe, God willing, we will prevail and triumph, fwa-salam aleikum. &gt; &gt; –George Galloway at Damascus University, November 2005 And interestingly &gt; The reference to the Tel al-Zataar massacre is significant. Galloway describes it correctly. As many or quite possibly more Palestinians were slaughtered by Phalangists at Tel al Zataar as at Sabra and Shatila. Nevertheless, the Assad family’s complicity in the slaughter of Palestinians – which Galloway knew about, as we can see – didn’t stop him from supporting them, or indeed presenting them as friends of the Palestinians. &gt; &gt; Why is this? &gt; &gt; Simple. As far as people like Galloway are concerned, it isn’t dead Palestinians that count. The identities of those who can be blamed for their deaths is the only thing that matters. &gt; &gt; It is for this reason that the Tel al-Zataar massacre is almost never mentioned, commemorated or protested. The dead have been forgotten. Now he's obviously decided that Assad is doomed and he's started to talk about things like Tel al-Zataar.

","Well it is kind of a ""you fuck our economy, we'll fuck your economy"" position. Although that will lead to war, it will cripple the ailing economies of the western nations. The need for oil just for society to function is immense. If this oil started going towards multiple war machines we'd have a spiralling economic contraction regardless of what force or series of forces ""win"". That's just one way of looking at it. It's very interesting on a geo-political level. Iran could potentially have the backing of Russia and China in this showdown. The US could have the backing of parts of Europe, Japan, Israel and some of the Sunni powers. India is a wildcard. The thing that I know is that the common people don't benefit from this war in any of the aforementioned countries. The rich get richer, power flows to some new combination of forces and life becomes more and more controlled. Not to mention the potential loss of life on a massive scale this kind of war could create. Plus the privation, the hungry masses, the brutal crackdowns on dissent. All so that people that think the world is their chessboard can make an important move.

","If you dig back into headlines a while ago, you will find that India had supported Iran too. Then when the Indo US civilian nuclear deal came about, India had to back out of supporting Iran. This might seem to be political and what not, but it has nothing to do with world politics. People outside India forget that India has a sizeable Muslim population. No political party will ever go against any Islamic nation as they fear that it will hurt 'sentiments' of the Muslim vote bank. Yes, there is vote bank politics in India based on religion, caste and regionalism. So tomorrow, if there was some minority in India which was the majority in, say North Korea, and politicians found that minority to be a good 'vote bank' then India would support North Korea too! So if India has supported Palestine, then good, but the real reason is minority vote bank politics within India. India maybe a younger democracy in comparison with the US but its the most complicated vote bank based politics that happens in India. As per my 'caste', I am not from a 'backward' caste, but now one major politician wants to show his sudden found love for my caste eying the next elections. So he has promised lots of government hand outs to people of my caste. And he is suddenly in love because most of the sugar cane growing (sugar is a big time cash crop in India) is done in areas where people of my caste come from. So he is willing to change the 'reservations' laws to include my caste as a 'reserved category' caste! :) :) All this for votes. And yes, people do vote based on caste and regionalism.

552,"Here's why I defend on Reddit the oppressive regime of Iran at every opportunity
I'm the first to admit (off Reddit) that Iran has a somewhat oppressive regime, although I wouldn't call myself an expert on world affairs.

However, I find myself continually defending Iran *on* reddit, and I think I have a very strong reason to do so.

Firstly, the regime itself is pretty peaceful.  It has never started a war with anyone, and suffered badly in the Iran/Iraq war, started by Saddam Hussein.

I do know enough of the history of Iran to know that it was subject to a coup organized by Britain and the USA, and it had to endure years of totalitarian rule by the Shah, who, by all accounts was a puppet of these powers, and quite oppressive in his own right.

The revolution changed all that, and, although Iran's Islamic regime is also oppressive, the regime itself has much of the Western world arrayed against it. 

It's also pretty clear that Iran's self determination is strategically irritating for the Western world, as Iran is a large country with huge oil reserve, and therefore in a strong position to influence world affairs.

So, Iran has been subject to an unrelenting barrage of negative propaganda, principally from the United States and Israel.  I expect that they ultimately hope to achieve some kind of regime change, perhaps one more sympathetic to their needs.

This is not a good climate for human rights reform, and any overture for peace from the Iranian regime is pretty much rejected outright by the Western world.  

I see this as quite unfair.  Iran is not perfect, but it does not deserve the amount of censure it receives from the Western media.  There are many far more deserving targets, including The Congo.

For that reason, I push back as hard as I can against any sniff of anti-Iran propaganda, just to provide a little balance.

I hope that Iran improves, but with the whole Western world against it, it is going to be an uphill battle.

603,"Why Is The Muslim World So Easily Offended?
","Full text for mobile users who can't get the mobile site to load: Modernity requires the willingness to be offended. And as anti-American violence across the Middle East and beyond shows, that willingness is something the Arab world, the heartland of Islam, still lacks. Time and again in recent years, as the outside world has battered the walls of Muslim lands and as Muslims have left their places of birth in search of greater opportunities in the Western world, modernity — with its sometimes distasteful but ultimately benign criticism of Islam — has sparked fatal protests. To understand why violence keeps erupting and to seek to prevent it, we must discern what fuels this sense of grievance. There is an Arab pain and a volatility in the face of judgment by outsiders that stem from a deep and enduring sense of humiliation. A vast chasm separates the poor standing of Arabs in the world today from their history of greatness. In this context, their injured pride is easy to understand. In the narrative of history transmitted to schoolchildren throughout the Arab world and reinforced by the media, religious scholars and laymen alike, Arabs were favored by divine providence. They had come out of the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century, carrying Islam from Morocco to faraway Indonesia. In the process, they overran the Byzantine and Persian empires, then crossed the Strait of Gibraltar to Iberia, and there they fashioned a brilliant civilization that stood as a rebuke to the intolerance of the European states to the north. Cordoba and Granada were adorned and exalted in the Arab imagination. Andalusia brought together all that the Arabs favored — poetry, glamorous courts, philosophers who debated the great issues of the day. If Islam’s rise was spectacular, its fall was swift and unsparing. This is the world that the great historian Bernard Lewis explored in his 2002 book “What Went Wrong?” The blessing of God, seen at work in the ascent of the Muslims, now appeared to desert them. The ruling caliphate, with its base in Baghdad, was torn asunder by a Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Soldiers of fortune from the Turkic Steppes sacked cities and left a legacy of military seizures of power that is still the bane of the Arabs. Little remained of their philosophy and literature, and after the Ottoman Turks overran Arab countries to their south in the 16th century, the Arabs seemed to exit history; they were now subjects of others. The coming of the West to their world brought superior military, administrative and intellectual achievement into their midst — and the outsiders were unsparing in their judgments. They belittled the military prowess of the Arabs, and they were scandalized by the traditional treatment of women and the separation of the sexes that crippled Arab society. Even as Arabs insist that their defects were inflicted on them by outsiders, they know their weaknesses. Younger Arabs today can be brittle and proud about their culture, yet deeply ashamed of what they see around them. They know that more than 300 million Arabs have fallen to economic stagnation and cultural decline. They know that the standing of Arab states along the measures that matter — political freedom, status of women, economic growth — is low. In the privacy of their own language, in daily chatter on the street, on blogs and in the media, and in works of art and fiction, they probe endlessly what befell them. Page 2 of 3 But woe to the outsider who ventures onto that explosive terrain. The assumption is that Westerners bear Arabs malice, that Western judgments are always slanted and cruel. In the past half-century, Arabs, as well as Muslims in non-Arab lands, have felt the threat of an encircling civilization they can neither master nor reject. Migrants have left the burning grounds of Karachi, Cairo and Casablanca but have taken the fire of their faith with them. “Dish cities” have sprouted in the Muslim diasporas of Western Europe and North America. You can live in Stockholm and be sustained by a diet of al-Jazeera television. We know the celebrated cases when modernity has agitated the pious. A little more than two decades ago, it was a writer of Muslim and Indian birth, Salman Rushdie, whose irreverent work of fiction, “The Satanic Verses,” offended believers with its portrayal of Islam. That crisis began with book-burnings in Britain, later saw protests in Pakistan and culminated in Iran’s ruling cleric, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issuing a fatwa calling for Rushdie’s death in 1989. The protesters were not necessarily critics of fiction; all it took to offend was that Islam, the prophet Muhammad and his wives had become a writer’s material. The confrontation laid bare the unease of Islam in the modern world. The floodgates had opened. The clashes that followed defined the new terms of encounters between a politicized version of Islam — awakened to both power and vulnerability — and the West’s culture of protecting and nurturing free speech. In 2004, a Moroccan Dutchman in his mid-20s, Mohammed Bouyeri, murdered filmmaker Theo van Goghon a busy Amsterdam street after van Gogh and a Somali-born politician made a short film about the abuse of women in Islamic culture. Shortly afterward, trouble came to Denmark when a newspaper there published a dozencartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad; in one he wears a bomb-shaped turban, and another shows him as an assassin. The newspaper’s culture editor had thought the exercise would merely draw attention to the restrictions on cultural freedom in Europe — but perhaps that was naive. After all, Muslim activists are on the lookout for such material. And Arab governments are eager to defend Islam. The Egyptian ambassador to Denmark encouraged a radical preacher of Palestinian birth living in Denmark and a young Lebanese agitator to fan the flames of the controversy. But it was Syria that made the most of this opportunity. The regime asked the highest clerics to preach against the Danish government. The Danish embassies in Damascus and Beirut were sacked; there was a call to boycott Danish products. Denmark had been on the outer margins of Europe’s Muslim diaspora. Now its peace and relative seclusion were punctured. The storm that erupted this past week at the gates of American diplomatic outposts across the Muslim world is a piece of this history. As usual, it was easily ignited. The offending work, a 14-minute film trailer posted on YouTube in July, is offensive indeed. Billed as a trailer for “The Innocence of Muslims,” a longer movie to come, it is at once vulgar and laughable. Its primitiveness should have consigned it to oblivion. Page 3 of 3 It was hard to track down the identities of those who made it. A Sam Bacile claimed authorship, said that he was an Israeli American and added that 100Jewish businessmen had backed the venture. This alone made it rankle even more — offending Muslims and implicating Jews at the same time. (In the meantime, no records could be found of Bacile, and the precise origins of the video remain murky.) It is never hard to assemble a crowd of young protesters in the teeming cities of the Muslim world. American embassies and consulates are magnets for the disgruntled. It is inside those fortresses, the gullible believe, that rulers are made and unmade. Yet these same diplomatic outposts dispense coveted visas and a way out to the possibilities of the Western world. The young men who turned up at the U.S. Embassies this week came out of this deadly mix of attraction to American power and resentment of it. The attack in Benghazi, Libya, that took the lives of four American diplomats, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, appeared to be premeditated and unconnected to the film protests. The ambivalence toward modernity that torments Muslims is unlikely to abate. The temptations of the West have alienated a younger generation from its elders. Men and women insist that they revere the faith as they seek to break out of its restrictions. Freedom of speech, granting license and protection to the irreverent, is cherished, protected and canonical in the Western tradition. Now Muslims who quarrel with offensive art are using their newfound freedoms to lash out against it. These cultural contradictions do not lend themselves to the touch of outsiders. President George W. Bush believed that America’s proximity to Arab dictatorships had begotten us the jihadists’ enmity. His military campaign in Iraq became an attempt to reform that country and beyond. But Arabs rejected his interventionism and dismissed his “freedom agenda” as a cover for an unpopular war and for domination. President Obama has taken a different approach. He was sure that his biography — the years he spent in Indonesia and his sympathy for the aspirations of Muslim lands — would help repair relations between America and the Islamic world. But he’s been caught in the middle, conciliating the rulers while making grand promises to ordinary people. The revolt of the Iranian opposition in the summer of 2009 exposed the flaws of his approach. Then the Arab Spring played havoc with American policy. Since then, the Obama administration has not been able to decide whether it defends the status quo or the young people hell-bent on toppling the old order. Cultural freedom is never absolute, of course, and the Western tradition itself, from the Athenians to the present, struggles mightily with the line between freedom and order. In the Muslim world, that struggle is more fierce and lasting, and it will show itself in far more than burnt flags and overrun embassies.",0.0,0.0,0.0,positive,0.0

Bombastic! &gt; While Qatar and Saudi Arabia arm and fund the rebels of Syria to overthrow Bashar al-Assad's Alawite/Shia-Baathist dictatorship, Washington mutters not a word of criticism against them.... But Qatar is an autocracy and Saudi Arabia is among the most pernicious of caliphate-kingly-dictatorships in the Arab world. Ok, true. This isn't some great revelation, however. Pretty much everybody how knows a bit about the Middle East can tell you this. &gt; And we believe Saudi Arabia wants to set up a democracy in Syria? Who believes that? He just said above that they were working in their self interest. It just so happens that their best interest is democracy, since that will allow the Sunnis to dominate. &gt; Not a word have they uttered – nor their princely Sayed Hassan Nasrallah – about the rape and mass murder of Syrian civilians by Bashar's soldiers and ""Shabiha"" militia. True. Fisk is acting like self interest is a totally new concept in foreign policy. &gt; Then we have the heroes of America – La Clinton, the Defence Secretary Leon Panetta, and Obama himself. Clinton issues a ""stern warning"" to Assad. Panetta – the same man who repeated to the last US forces in Iraq that old lie about Saddam's connection to 9/11 – announces that things are ""spiralling out of control"" in Syria. They have been doing that for at least six months. Has he just realised? For the unfamiliar, the US hasn't been doing much so what exactly does Fisk want? It is clear that Fisk doesn't like US interventionism in the Middle East (he jabs at Iraq and Afghanistan). So why is he criticizing the US for not really doing anything? What does he want the US to do? &gt; And then Obama told us last week that ""given the regime's stockpile of*nuclear*weapons, we will continue to make it clear to Assad Obama didn't tell us that. Obama told us ""And given the regime’s stockpiles of*chemical*weapons, we will continue to make it clear to Assad and those around him that the world is watching"" Source. Fisk is making up shit in order to draw parallels between Syria and Iraq. Obama never said that Assad had nukes. &gt; Then there's that neighbouring country which owes us so much gratitude: Iraq. Last week, it suffered in one day 29 bombing attacks in 19 cities, killing 111 civilian and wounding another 235. The same day, Syria's bloodbath consumed about the same number of innocents. Cherry picking. Syria has seen far more deaths than Iraq since the beginning of Syria's civil war. Nothing recent in Iraq can compare to the massacres in Syria. &gt; But Iraq was ""down the page"" from Syria, buried ""below the fold"", as we journalists say; because, of course, we gave freedom to Iraq, Jeffersonian democracy, etc, etc, didn't we? So this slaughter to the east of Syria didn't have quite the same impact, did it? Nothing we did in 2003 led to Iraq's suffering today. Right? Straw man. Who is making this argument (the Jeffersonian democracy one)? &gt; But in a lamentable decision, the BBC – broadcasting ""world"" news to the world – also decided that the passage of the Olympic flame was more important than dying Syrian children, even when it has its own courageous reporter sending his despatches directly from Aleppo. So you want Syria to be headline news....but you want Iraq to be headline news cause you think it is just as bad (hint: it isn't). &gt; But when the scorecard of death in Syria reaches 15,000 or 19,000 – perhaps 14 times as many fatalities as in Israel's savage 2008-2009 onslaught on Gaza – scarcely a single protester, save for Syrian expatriates abroad, walks the streets to condemn these crimes against humanity. Israel's crimes have not been on this scale since 1948. Rightly or wrongly, the message that goes out is simple: we demand justice and the right to life for Arabs if they are butchered by the West and its Israeli allies; but not when they are being butchered by their fellow Arabs. Sort of agreed (Westerners aren't paying close enough attention). But what exactly do you want westerners to do? Back the same type of military intervention that you seem to hate? Cause marching on the streets without a goal doesn't accomplish anything. &gt; ""And all the while, we forget the ""big"" truth"" This should be good.... &gt; No, this is all about Iran and our desire to crush the Islamic Republic and its infernal nuclear plans But you just said that the US wasn't doing much. We aren't. And then you said that Westerners should be doing more. But now you say the West is doing stuff in order to squash Iran. Make up your mind. &gt; Quelle horreur! Indeed. So, the last paragraph is where the tile comes into play the West's target is Iran. That is why the West is turning a blind eye whilst Sunni fundamentalist governments arm the rebels to take down the Iranian-allied Shia government of Assad. But wait the West loves Israel (at least our government and politicians do). He says himself that we never criticize them. But, you see, Israel doesn't necessarily want Assad gone. Assad is the devil they know a guy who will rant and fume, but won't attack on the Golan Heights. Israel doesn't want a Sunni fundamentalist government, the thing that (according to Fisk) the Saudis and other gulf Arabs want, and Israel is the main target of Iran. So why would the West want to take down Assad in order to quell Iran? This makes no sense.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

","This line from the article really piqued my interest: ""The use of cluster munitions is banned by much of the world, although Syria, like the United States, is not party to that international convention."" I thought to myself, ""Why did the United States not signed any convention regarding the use of cluster bombs? So I turned to Wikipedia, specifically and read the following: ""The treaty was opposed by a number of countries that produce or stockpile significant quantities of cluster munitions, including China, Russia, the United States, India, Israel, Pakistan and Brazil. The U.S. has acknowledged humanitarian concerns about the use of cluster munitions, but insisted that the proper venue for a discussion of cluster munitions was the forum attached to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which includes all major military powers. The U.S. has further stated that the development and introduction of ""smart"" cluster munitions, where each submunition contains its own targeting and guidance system as well as an auto-self-destruct mechanism, means that the problematic munitions are being moved away from in any case.*In 2006, Barack Obama voted to support a legislative measure to limit use of the bombs, while his general election opponent John McCain and his primary opponent Hillary Clinton (now U.S. Secretary of State) both voted against it. According to the Pentagon’s 2008 policy, cluster munitions are actually humane weapons. “Because future adversaries will likely use civilian shields for military targets – for example by locating a military target on the roof of an occupied building – use of unitary weapons could result in more civilian casualties and damage than cluster munitions,” the policy claims. “Blanket elimination of cluster munitions is therefore unacceptable due not only to negative military consequences but also due to potential negative consequences for civilians.**”Obviously cluster munitions are really effective at eliminating only the intended over in the Middle East, because not a single civilian has died due to drone strikes*",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

Bibi: Turn off the camera and I'll tell you want I think. (22:00) (Then you see the camera off and back on for a moment.) Bibi: Now we're starting to understand the meaning of ""Y.S.A. is here"" [Y.S.A stands for Judea-Samaria-Gaza and YSA is also the word ""redemption"" in Hebrew] (22:29) Bibi: YSA is here. YSA is everywhere. What's the difference? What does Arafat want? He wants one big settlement and its name is Tel Aviv. Woman: Yes, that's what my daughter-in-law, when she arrives from England said: ""Tel Aviv is also a settlement"" (22:42) Bibi: As far as they're concerned, in my opinion, our territorial waters are also theirs. (22:45) That they want us in the sea, yes, but in the sea... [this is a reference to ""drive the Jews into the sea""] The Arabs are currently focusing a war of terror and they think that it will break us. (22:54)*The central thing is first to hit them. Not just one hit, multiple hits so painful that the price will be to heavy to bear. Right now the price isn't too heavy to bear.*An attack on multiple fronts on the Palestinian Authority. To bring them to fear that everything is collapsing. Woman: They don't fear, they laugh at us, they shot at our village in laughter... Bibi: (23:16) Fear that everything is collapsing, that's what will them to... Woman: Wait, but the world will again say, what are you conquering?

America is something that can be moved easily. Moved in the right direction.*(23:34) Boy: They say that they are in favor of us but, like... Bibi: They won't bother us. They won't bother us.

We have such support and we say: ""What are we going to do if..."" Bibi: Look, the government (of Clinton) was extermely Pro-Palestinian. I wasn't afraid to maneuver there. I wasn't afraid to confront Clinton. I wasn't afraid to confront the UN. Either way I'm paying the price internationally, so it's better that I get the benefit. Benefit for my payment. Boy: Oslo... regardless, we gave them things that we can now not take back from them because they won't give them back to us. Bibi: First of all, Oslo is a process... You're right. First, I don't know what we can or can't takeWoman: He [the boy] has political opinions, believe me... Bibi: He's right... Woman: He said to Arik Sharon things, I told him: ""This is not the opinion of a [simple] child."" The Oslo agreement is a disaster. Bibi: Yes, that you know and that I knew... Woman: Good, so I thought-Bibi: The people need to know. Woman: Right... but I thought that the prime minister would know and would do everything in order to, somehow, not do critical things, such as giving over Hebron. Bibi: What were the Oslo Accords? [rhetorical] The Oslo Accords, that the government signed... They asked me, before the elections, ""Will you enact...?"" I said: ""Yes, provided reciprocation and the limiting of retreating [of borders]."" ""How will you limit the retreat?"" I will give a meaning to the Oslo Accords that will allow me to stop this gallopping toward the borders of '67. How will I do this? [rhetorical again] [News anchor talks for a bit over Bibi's voice about what the Oslo Accords are and say something about a loophole.] Bibi: No one defined what a military area is. Marked off military areas, I said, are saftey areas. The Jordan valley, as far as I'm concerned, is a defined military zone. [Woman names some towns in the Jordan Valley] But then there was the question, ""who will define what is a military zone?"" I got a letter from Christopher (Clinton's secretary of state) to me and to Arafat at the same time, that says Israel, and Israel alone, she will decide what they are, the location of these military zones and their size. Now, they didn't want to give this letter, so I didn't give the Hebron agreement. I stopped the government meeting and said, ""I'm not signing."" Only when the letter arrived during the meeting, to me and to Arafat, did I sign the Hebron agreement. Or rather, I allowed it. It was already signed. Why is this important? (26:09)*Because at that moment, in essence, I stopped the Oslo agreement.*Woman: And despite that, one of our people, sorry, that knew that it was a trick and that we are committing suicide with the Oslo accord, gives them for example, Hebron. I never understood this. Bibi: Truly Hebron hurts. Truly. That's one of the things that hurts. Bibi: One of the famous rabbis, the I much honor, rabbi of Israel, said: ""What would your father say?"" I went to my father, you know my father's stance? My dad... he's not exactly a white dove, as they say. So my father heard the question and he said,(26:48) ""Tell the rabbi that your grandfather, Rabbi Nathan Milikovski, was a smart Jew. Tell him that it's better to give 2% than to give 100%. And that's the option that was on the table."" You gave 2 percent and that's how you stopped that retreat [of borders] instead of giving 100%. The smart thing isn't to be there and to break.

We were in a taxi, stopped at a light in Ramat Aviv traffic, when the sound enveloped us. People in the streets looked dazed as to what to do. However, the picture became clear when the lady in the car next to me got out and crouched down in the road, protectively using her vehicle as a shield.

Rather than staying home where we would be close to our Mamet (a secure room with steel rolled down window shields and special door), we went out to see what our neighbors were doing and saying. It was Thursday night, the beginning of the Israeli weekend when the streets are busy with social life…but not tonight. It was noticeably quiet. The cafes were practically empty; the traffic was non-existent; the buses empty and the street with few casual shoppers. The residents here know that this attack on Tel Aviv will make a huge difference tonight and everyone was staying home. The IDF did not disappoint its citizens. Within a few hours more than 70 sites in Gaza were targeted and successfully taken out. Places where recently fired rockets were located, where stockpiles of newly received Iranian long-range rockets were kept and where electrical power could be eliminated. Now it is Friday and the sirens went off again in Tel Aviv around 1:28PM. This time we were walking on Bograshov Street, 3 blocks from our apartment. People ran and we followed them into a building that I had heard was a makeshift shelter for people who work in the stores and cafes on this one block, as well as locals walking by. We quickly made our way to the stairwell that ran next to the elevator and walked down to the basement level. That is where we stayed until the locals felt it was safe to come out.

So, here, in the spirit of public service, allow me to present you withfactsabout the region (not my opinion) and see if it might just make a dent in the stratospherically naive commentary seen here so far (these numbers are a bit dated, but they are approximately correctcertainly enough to make the point): Israel has 7M people, their enemies number around 350M Israel has about 1/500th the land their enemies do Since the formation of the modern state of Israel, something around 80,000 (or less) people have died in all their conflicts that's both sides, civilian and military total. In that same period of time over 3millionMuslims around the world have killed ....each other*, yet somehow the discussion always revolves around those naughty Jews. The fact is that intra-Muslim (Arab and Persian) violence vastly eclipses the Jewish-Muslim conflict. The Jews could all pull out and move somewhere else and NOTHING MUCH would change because they are NOT the central problem causing all the violence the thugs running the countries around them are the problem. There is no real distinct ethnicity known as a ""Palestinian"". Prior to 1948, if your passport said ""Palestinian"" you could just as easily be Jewish, Arab, or Other living in those lands. The whole ""Palestinian"" thing is a political construct ginned up for other reasons. In actual fact, these people are most closely related to modern Jordanians. When Jordan ran the area now occupied by the ""Palestinians"" back in the day, they hadfewercivil liberties and rights than they do under Israeli ""occupation"".

Therefore a blockade can be used by warring parties against each other. You would say that israel is using collective punishment againts the population due to the actions of a terrorist group.

Remember that people just disappear in the surrounding non-democratic arab nations. Further, many Reddit postings seem to enjoy equating Israel and the Jews with the Nazi's as an ironic and bitter insult. For those who seem to enjoy this comparison please note that Judge Richard Goldstone is in fact a Jewish South African who helped expose and bring down the South African apartheid. Further, Israel is a democracy (albeit one that borders on apartheid) but is certainly not fascist. Every people and country have good and bad policies: The Americans invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to assassinate Castro and did not let Blacks vote until about 50 years ago! 25 years ago Canada forced the Natives away from their families and reserves into residential schools where they were physically, sexually and emotionally abused. The list goes on and on. Again, this does not justify Israel's human rights violations in any way but context is important.

1066,"French lawmakers passed a measure on Thursday to make it a crime to deny the mass killing of Armenians in 1915 by Ottoman Turks was a genocide
","I posted this in another thread as a response to the question of ""Why Turkey doesn't get along with its neighbors"" but people got carried away with it. I'll post it here also as a Turkish viewpoint of the issue. &gt; Here's the post: Well, Israel: Raided a Turkish ship (that only had relief supplies) on international waters and ignored Turkey's request for an apology. Greece: Wants to search for oil in Aegean sea, which can mean as close as 12 nautical miles from the Turkish coasts. No nation will allow such a thing if something similar was done to them. Cyprus: Apart from open hate messages from their national press (even during natural disasters occurred in Turkey), their entire foreign policy is to say no to anything involving Turkey. Thing is, everyone wants to enforce this treaty. Armenia have always said that it is the next step after Turkey accepting the genocide. Greece have always wanted it, up until the economic crisis, their #1 military policy was to match Turkey's military presence around Aegean sea at all costs. The PKK insurrection is a foreign funded propaganda that uses Kurdistan as promised land to ignite Turkish/Kurdish racism. I can go on about the Istanbul and Çanakkale straits etc etc. Ottoman Empire never tried assimilating the cultures it conquered (until the very, very late stages) because it was against Islam (intolerance against cultures/religions is a great sin in Islam). After 800 years (and awful last 2 centuries due to decline of Ottoman Empire) it was very easy to ignite prejudice against Turks. Last 90 or so years (of enlightenment) haven't done anything to ease the prejudice, arguably it strengthened it despite all odds. What would you do, what can you do after considering these facts? tl;dr Nationalism is the new racism, same as the old stuff.*Edit:*I wrote this post to describe why Turkey has never gotten along with its neighbors. Not for Armenian Genocide. Since people are trying to pull the post to that, I'll write a proper Turkish viewpoint for it. The Armenian genocide is a touchy subject, from Turkish view point, all evidence comes from Armenian side (that has the agenda of enforcing this) and 3-4 (quite literally) Ottoman sources from obscure places. Not all Armenian people have the agenda of claiming Turkish territory, but there are enough high profiled voices to scare off Turkish politicians start a fear mongering campaign against openly discussing Armenian genocide. What 99% of the Turkish people wants: Making an unbiased historical committee to determine the validity of the claims. Thats it. Even those who are 110% certain that it never happened, wants an unbiased research about the issue. Armenia's refusal of such a thing validates extremist viewpoint in Turkey and further cements any chance of Turkey accepting this issue. Thats basically Turkish view point on the issue. We are proud of our heritage, but also very, very insecure about it. Racism towards us further strengthens our insecurities and damages our trust of foreign nations. There's saying, ""For a Turk only a Turk can be a friend"", this comes from centuries of Ottoman (and Republic) decline. I understand how ridiculous this can be seen from Armenian side. To them, its unimaginable frustrating to be wronged so much, and be refused even an apology, or even an acknowledgement. I can see how they see it as incredibly unjust it is for them. Personally, I truly believe an*unbiased*historical committee can resolve this issue, and Turkish people will accept the result of the study, no matter the result. Sadly such a thing will never happen, because both sides will never back down from their righteous wrath. Things like this (France) doesn't help the situation either, all it does is to rekindle the flame of extreme patriotism from both sides.

A loaded question. Every Arab states' expenditures reveal that even if they had any intention of wiping Israel off the map (anyone paying attention can see it's the reverseIsrael has never stopped expanding, not vice versa) it was never put anywhere close to practice.*This book, by the former academic director of the National Defense College of the Israeli military, explains how all Arab states have low military expenditures relative to Israel, and had they really sought to be angry and bitchy, they could have raised spending, fought Israel and destroyed it. They did not because they never had any serious intention of doing so, being far more concerned with appeasing the West for foreign aid.**. Furthermore, contrary to Zionist propaganda, none of the Arab states tried to wipe Israel out in 1948; they attempted to move in to protect Palestinians in the Arab partition areas that Israel decided to conquer instead of going back to the drawing board when the Palestinians rejected the ridiculous, foreign-imposed partition plan. As for not spending it on infrastructure or heathcare, depending on which Arab state and which time period, both of those are lies (i.e. Nasser did expand spending on infrastructure and healthcare in Egypt), but the answer is obvious: They are post-colonial dictatorships. They came into existence the same way as Israel did: European colonizers enabled them to do so. Which is why the article is such a crock of shit. It tries to treat Israel's growth as a settler colonial regime and the rise of Arab dictatorships as two mutually opposite developments. That is a complete lie. Ever since the British permitted and enabled the creation of the institutions that allowed Israel to become a thriving, heavily developed state during the British mandate, the same colonial occupiers (Britain and France) ensured that Arab regimes remain weak, divided, and essentially, colonized. And despite creating a legal regime opposed to such colonialism, the United States largely took up their role in the aftermath of World War II. So trying to compare the Arab dictatorships, which, thanks to heavy US and European military aid, have prevented serious development in the Arab world, with a state that the Europeans coddled and aided even before it was even createdIsraelis utter bullshit.

How does this make any sense, Israel??? WTF! Footnote: And before anyone says it, the so-called Cohen gene found among 1% of black Ethiopians was later established asnotbeing definitive of Jewish ancestry. Arabs have it and so do surrounding Iraqis, Armenians, Kurds, etc. So it's not a genetic sign of Jewish ancestry at all. As for how Ethiopians got it [the 1% who do, that is], genetic dating has placed it from the time period when Yemenis went back and forth from Arabia to the Horn of Africa. That's why Somalis and Ethiopians have such high rates of admixture—but it's with Yemenis, not with Jews. So Ethiopian Jews are, by any rational measure, no more related to the ancient Israelites than Australian aborigines are.] As for Palestinians? They have the Cohen gene at higher rates than even Jews do, if you want to use that refuted method as an indicator. What's not refuted, though, is that Palestinians share about 90% of their DNA with modern Jews. The rate of similtude is even higher when you test them against Middle Eastern Jews, where the two groups are genetically indistinguishable.

It is a heartbreaking picture, and I say this as someone staunchly pro-Israel and supportive of air strikes on Gaza. An image like this can leave an indelible mark on the average person with little knowledge of the conflict and why Israel launched air strikes to begin with. But if you look deeper, you discover that not all is what it seems. Only one problem: he was killed by a Hamas rocket that fell short in Gaza. There is a lot of evidence for this. Read the New York Times’ account of his death: The Abu Wardah family woke up on Friday morning to word that a hudna — Arabic for cease-fire — had been declared during the three-hour visit of the Egyptian prime minister to this embattled territory. So, after two days of huddling indoors to avoid intensifying Israeli air assaults, Abed Abu Wardah, the patriarch, went to the market to buy fruits and vegetables. His 22-year-old son, Aiman, took an empty blue canister to be refilled with cooking gas. The younger children of their neighborhood, Annazla, in this town north of Gaza City went out to the dirt alley to kick a soccer ball. But around 9:45 a.m., family members and neighbors said, an explosion struck a doorway near the Abu Wardah home, killing Aiman Abu Wardah as he returned from his errand, as well as Mahmoud Sadallah, 4, who lived next door and had refused his older cousin’s pleas to stay indoors. It is unclear who was responsible for the strike on Annazla: the damage was nowhere near severe enough to have come from an Israeli F-16, raising the possibility that an errant missile fired by Palestinian militants was responsible for the deaths. What seems clear is that expectations for a pause in the fighting, for at least one family, were tragically misplaced. The IDF did not launch any airstrikes in Gaza while Egyptian PM Kandil was in Gaza. AP adds: Mahmoud Sadallah, the 4-year-old Gaza boy whose death moved Egypt’s prime minister to tears, was from the town of Jebaliya, close to Gaza City. The boy died Friday in hotly disputed circumstances. The boy’s aunt, Hanan Sadallah, and his grief-stricken father Iyad — weak from crying and leaning on others to walk — said Mahmoud was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Hamas security officials also made that claim. Israel vehemently denied involvement, saying it had not carried out any attacks in the area at the time. Mahmoud’s family said the boy was in an alley close to his home when he was killed, along with a man of about 20, but no one appeared to have witnessed the strike. The area showed signs that a projectile might have exploded there, with shrapnel marks in the walls of surrounding homes and a shattered kitchen window. But neighbors said local security officials quickly took what remained of the projectile, making it impossible to verify who fired it. If it was an Israeli missile, you can be sure that it would have been shown to the media! Furthermore, PCHR, which is keeping track of everyone killed in Gaza (and which admits that most of the dead have been “militants,”) did not list Mahmoud Sadalha or Aiman Aby Wardah in their list of victims of Israeli airstrikes, although they even include one person who died of a heart attack. Put this together with the fact that Hamas and other terror groups were firing rockets throughout Friday morning while the IDF did not, plus the fact that over 100 rockets have fallen short in Gaza (both using past performance and IDF statistics as proof), and the fact that the shrapnel in the video matches almost exactly the shrapnel damage we have seen from rocket fire into Israel, and it is very clear: this child was killed by Gaza rocket fire, not by Israel.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

Maybe there are some really great success stories of the Palestinian authority? Have they opened any new universities lately? Have they opened any new secondary or elementary schools? What are Palestinians doing to help their people...their brothers/sisters? What are the other Arab states that are so flush with cash from oil doing to help the Palestinian people?

The incident happened soon after Jerusalem's secular mayor, Nir Barkat, left the station after speaking out against gender discrimination.

1422,"""Mr Netanyahu does not need to persuade even his American congressional sponsors of his desire to move forward in peace. He merely needs to persuade them that he has done enough to continue to pretend that the absence of peace is not his fault.""
","Israelis DO want peace. In fact, in the last election, MK Tzipi Livni of Kadima (the moderate party in Israel's 'Parliament') got more votes than Netanyahu. Unfortunately, she was not able to form a coalition, and that is now Netanyahu became PM for the second miserable time. Tzipi Livni is now the opposition leader of the Knesset (Parliament), and she released a statement IN SUPPORT OF Obama's speech. Even before his following ""clarifications"" at AIPAC. The truth is, Israelis are a lot more liberal about Israeli politics than American Jews are. Israelis criticize their government like it's a national sport. For the second time in Israel's history, Netanyahu came into power by some electoral fluke (not by fraud, but by the skin of his teeth), and hasn't done sh*t to achieve peace. In America, controversial issues tend to have a very polarizing effect. Many of the ""pro-Israel"" people I know LURVE Netanyahu, and they say bullsh*t like ""The 1967 (borders) solution is the Final Solution"" and ""Obama wants Israel to negotiate peace more than even the Palestinians do!"" Whereas the ""liberal"" people I know say bullsh*t like ""We must boycott Israel and stop giving them foreign aid"" and ""Israel is carrying out genocide against the Palestinians"" and ""Israel is evil bla bla bla..."" There's very little middle ground here, but there is in Israel. They want someone to negotiate peace--I think it's evident in the way Israelis vote. Americans need to realize that criticizing Israel is not anti-Semitic, and it's not unAmerican. We CAN tell Israel what to do, because we support their military in a huge way. When Netanyahu says sh*t like ""Israel is the only democracy in the middle east; Israel is not what is wrong here, it's what's right,"" that is not an excuse for prolonging the occupation! AS the only developed, democratic nation in the Middle East, Israel must live up to its name. HOWEVER, painting Israel as the most evil nation on the face of the planet is equally wrong. One must remember, Israel never sought to ""conquer"" Gaza and the West Bank, that land was acquired in war in which Israel DEFENDED herself. They tried to exchange the land for peace (the way they did with the Sinai), but that did not work. Additionally, Israel built the first Universities in the occupied land, they gave the Palestinians access to health care, electricity and running water. They have always allowed Palestinians to organize politically, and to work within the borders of Israel proper. Citizens of the West Bank have a higher living standard than in many other Arab nations. When the West Bank was under Jordanian control, their rights were denied, it was illegal to fly a Palestinian flag, and they suffered starvation and intense poverty. 1967 borders are a good framework to begin with, but we must admit that the war of 1967 was one of defense, and Israel won. At some point, Arab nations have to admit they lost, and Palestinians can't just whine and ask people to pretend the war never happened. It did, they declared it, they lost. Just like the War of Independence. War has a price, especially if you lose. The fact that Israel is willing to give anything back is more than what any Western nation would do.

Jamal Muhaisen, member of the Fatah Central Committee, said that it was “impossible” for the Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. “No Palestinians could ever accept such a demand, no matter where he is and what job he holds,” he said. “This recognition would scrap the right of return for the Palestinian refugees and endanger the status of the Palestinians living in the territories that were occupied in 1948.” The Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine pointed out that Abed Rabbo’s statements contradicted the official policy of the PA and the PLO and urged all Palestinians to “hold him accountable.” The group accused Abed Rabbo of endorsing a “defeatist and irresponsible” approach. Hassan Khraisheh, Deputy Speaker for the Palestinian Legislative Council, denounced Abed Rabbo’s remarks as “dangerous” and said they reflected a state of defeat and helplessness. “By saying he will recognize Israel as a Jewish state, Abed Rabbo has crossed all red lines,” he said. “These remarks harm the right of return and our people in the territories occupied in 1948.” Hamas called for bringing the PLO official to trial for high treason and a “criminal who has betrayed the rights of the Palestinians and the blood of our martyrs.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,negative,0.0

The Navy, meanwhile, used Israeli Pioneer pilotless drones for reconnaissance in the Gulf. · Israel provided mine plows that were used to clear paths for allied forces through Iraqi minefields. · Mobile bridges flown directly from Israel to Saudi Arabia were employed by the U.S. Marine Corps. · Israeli recommendations, based upon system performance observations, led to several software changes that made the Patriot a more capable missile defense system. · Israel Aircraft Industries developed conformal fuel tanks that enhanced the range of F 15 aircraft. These were used in the Gulf. · General Dynamics has implemented a variety of Israeli modifications to improve the worldwide F 16 aircraft fleet, including structural enhancements, software changes, increased capability landing gear, radio improvements and avionic modifications. · An Israeli-produced targeting system was used to increase the Cobra helicopter's night-fighting capabilities. · Israel manufactured the canister for the highly successful Tomahawk missile. · Night-vision goggles used by U.S. forces were supplied by Israel. · A low-altitude warning system produced and developed in Israel was utilized on Blackhawk helicopters. · Other Israeli equipment provided to U.S. forces included flack vests, gas masks and sandbags. · Israel offered the United States the use of military and hospital facilities. U.S. ships utilized Haifa port shipyard maintenance and support on their way to the Gulf. · Israel destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981.

","Worth reading. Here's part: This same vile and stupid hatred has run amuck in Israel and the Middle East for hundreds if not thousands of years and the Liberals and our own president are petty enough to embrace it as a cause. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lives with millions of senseless haters all around him. He is not one man who can send a well placed round through the center of mass and let the bears and wolves destroy any trace of the incident. No not at all. he is a responsible leader in charge of the welfare of millions, he takes his job seriously instead of being focused on transforming his country according to a failed Socialist ideology. He established himself as a leading statesman of the world and made Obama appear to be a sniveling amateur when he addressed the US congress. He expressed himself well and concisely laid out his position on the Israeli-Palestinian problem. Unlike Obama’s rainbows and lollipops speeches, Ntanyahu dealt with reality and cold hard facts in front of congress and the American people. Without note cards or teleprompter, he showed Americans what a true orator and statesman sounds like. There are problems in the Middle East and most of them relate to medieval Muslim hatred of the Jew, it is politely called anti-Semitism. The question of the Palestinian and his rightful place in the world is a dubious claim at best. Yet, Netanyahu handled the situation of Palestinian legitimacy and our president’s sympathy for the Palestinian cause with grace and tact. This is the land of our forefathers, the Land of Israel, to which Abraham brought the idea of one God, where David set out to confront Goliath, and where Isaiah saw a vision of eternal peace. No distortion of history can deny the four thousand year old bond, between the Jewish people and the Jewish land. But there is another truth: The Palestinians share this small land with us. We seek a peace in which they will be neither Israel’s subjects nor its citizens. They should enjoy a national life of dignity as a free, viable and independent people in their own state. They should enjoy a prosperous economy, where their creativity and initiative can flourish. So this is a classic Western — indeed a classic liberal Western — formulation. We have our rights but we also respect your rights. Let’s find a win-win situation that benefits everyone. They were simply unwilling to end the conflict. And I regret to say this: They continue to educate their children to hate. They continue to name public squares after terrorists. And worst of all, they continue to perpetuate the fantasy that Israel will one day be flooded by the descendants of Palestinian refugees. My friends, this must come to an end. President Abbas must do what I have done. I stood before my people, and I told you it wasn’t easy for me, and I said… I will accept a Palestinian state. It is time for President Abbas to stand before his people and say… “I will accept a Jewish state.” These six words, “I will accept a Palestinian state” will alter history and make our president’s pleas for the Palestinian cause an impotent argument. Those six words will change history. They will make clear to the Palestinians that this conflict must come to an end. That they are not building a state to continue the conflict with Israel, but to end it. They will convince the people of Israel that they have a true partner for peace. With such a partner, the people of Israel will be prepared to make a far reaching compromise. I will be prepared to make a far reaching compromise. In other words, once the Palestinians really acknowledge — which they have not done — the Jewish connection to the land, Israel will know they are a partner for peace and make more compromises. The response of Abbas: We say to him [Netanyahu], when he claims — that they have a historical right dating back to 3000 years — we say that the nation of Palestine upon the land of Canaan had a 7000 year history. This is the truth, which must be understood and we have to note it, in order to say: “Netanyahu, you are incidental in history. We are the people of history. We are the owners of history.” Netanyahu has taken the Liberal approach, he is ready for a Palestinian state and Peace, but the Palestinians must be ready for peace. Abbas and his Palestinians are taking the role of the Fascist National Socialists of WWII and capitulation will be seized as a staging area for the final attack on Israel. Predictably Abbas declared Netanyahu’s speech a declaration of war. In effect, ending Obama’s public support for his beloved Palestinians and making further efforts by Liberals at promoting the Palestinian cause seem like a waste of time and a contradiction of common sense. This is a repetitious scenario that has been repeated in ’48, ’67, and ’73. The Arab Muslims let their hatred of the jew boil over and they meet with biblical retribution. Without a doubt, our president and the Jew haters of the world believe if they hamstring Israel enough, they will be able to mount a successful war and annihilate the Jewish people once and for all. I fear that many American Jews and our president are willing to risk the destruction of Israel as a form of appeasement or capitulation so that the Muclim fanatic will settle down. This is a fool’s vision, the conquest of Europe and America will follow the annihilation of Israel, for no amount of capitulation will satisfy the blood lust of the haters of the Middle East.",0.0,0.0,0.0,positive,0.0

The film is a split screen. On the right is the bustling market street of Bab al-Zawiya, in the Palestinian-dominated H1 sector of the town. On the left is al-Shuhada street in H2, once also a busy market for Palestinians but now empty due to Israeli restrictions and settler violence. Very true. I'll probably get buried by a purely knee-jerk reaction by those people who see my name and think 'enemy!' right away, but this part is interesting. I would very much like to see that film. Those same people now follow me around and harass me anywhere I go on this website, but I feel very strongly about Hebron. I can show you pictures of the market there that is all boarded up. It's depressing as hell. The only place I found to do business was this Palestinian pottery factory. Inside they are making bowls and stuff, painting them for glazing. It's a cool place to hang out and buy some gifts. I also looked down into H1 and saw the new spiritual center and this bustling city. I wanted to go down in there but I doubt the IDF would have been happy about it. Christiansaren't forbidden, but if something happened they would have to rescue me, which would be bad. Checkpoints work both ways people. I didn't see them refusing anyone for coming in either, but people did search bags and do pat downs. Anyhow, it looks like a cool place I would like to visit someday. Also worth noting is the IDF didn't like the settlers. They had recently evicted a bunch of them from some weird building and threw all their furniture and shit all over the place. People just don't get how complex things are... it isn't black and white and hopefully films like these show that.

1703,"US Warns Iran Not To Fight Back Against Israeli Attack
","This quote was too good to let pass without sharing posted by wearethey Every government on earth is antichrist and all are guilty. There are no good guys. Every nation, in it’s own peculiar way, is fulfilling its prophesied role in these last days. Mason founded America is the Biblical “Daughter of Babylon” that is the Mother of the Abominations of the earth; abortion, porn, drugs, rock music, witchcraft, eugenics etc. We were once a golden cup in God’s hand but it looks like we are not going to repent of our sins on a national scale. Very sad. People that Israel bash on here will be happy to know that at some point in the near future the Daughter of Babylon (America) will betray Isreal and not live up to our defense commitment to her. It will probably be a re-elected Obama that fulfills this part of the prophecy, thanks, in part to American Christians for not wielding their political influence in support of Ron Paul, who, with the support of this large demographic would easily defeat Barry Obama (or, maybe in a startling upset, Ron Paul will become President and it is he who betrays Israel?) The bottom line is this; when it comes down to it, at the very least America is about to be judged for the 53,000,000 innocent lives that have suffered “the wrath of her fornication s”. The wrath of fornication is abortion. Liberty can only be maintained when the population is righteous in their lifestyle, and at this point in time we don’t even deserve liberty. The life goal of virtue and righteousness as embodied in the Lord Jesus was dealt a fatal blow in the 60′s. Yes, there has been an ongoing conspiracy by the elite against us; but we are responsible for falling into their satanic trap by turning our backs on the living God, and denying the Lord Jesus, who is the truth, the way, and life. He is our only protection from the enemy of mankind. He is our Savior from sin and our Redeemer to his Father that we have all sinned against in our pride. Let’s not let our thirst for truth and justice go unquenched. Trust not in man, but trust in God who became man and died an ignoble death at the hands of His own creation so that we may live!

Castro appeared relaxed and lucid in the hour and a half long TV interview the first appearance since he was seriously ill four years ago.Fidel Castro warns nuclear war is coming This is a long convoluted complex situation long discussed by us. I am glad he brought this out in the open because we know Dmitri Medvedev just announced that Iran is close to developing a nuclear weapon. We have discussed Ad nauseum North Korea being dropped from the list of terrorist states and the so called axis of evil while they continue to threaten nuclear war and destruction. We have discussed often that the non aligned states because of Bush were siding with Iran, calling for our destruction as usual, and aligning behind Russia to take us on in what presumably would have been a nuclear war. We discussed the nasty surprise China had for us called the assassins mace which would shut down our entire military ability including our navy and nuclear weapons. We discussed HAARP which would enable us to shut down Russia and China's ability. We discussed also Ad Nauseum the fact that Iran has been seeking nuclear weapons since we gave them nuclear abilities in a 1950s program titled atoms for peace. Ever since Iran and Israel have been preparing to go after each other. I have been very concerned that Israel would attack Iran dragging us into it. I could not fathom a nuclear war developing there despite the rhetoric because someone has to be able to live there. I figured there would be a war to whatever degree because there will never be peace there as only the US wanted it.

1772,"The Arab Lobby: The European Component 
","&gt;There are many suppositions why Europeans tilt against Israel and toward the Arabs. For one thing, the Middle East is a place where Europeans can flaunt their foreign policy independence from the United States without responsibility for causing catastrophic results because they assume that the United States will protect Israel from any dire consequences such may produce. For another, Europe depends more heavily on trade with the Arab world and on Arab oil exports than does the United States. &gt;For example, the Arab gulf states are a $300 billion import market for world products,[20] compared to Israel's $50 billion imports.[21] Europe may also have a desire to appease the ""strong horse"" in the region (e.g., Israel has but one vote in the U.N.; the Arabs have twenty-five votes, the Muslim nations, fifty votes). Then there is the guilt among many Europeans over their discredited imperial past, leading them to falsely view Israelis as oppressing Third World peoples. Then, again, it may be the growing influence of Europe's own Muslim populations (e.g., Arabs in France, Turks in Germany, South Asians in Britain) and their need to keep such segments of their domestic populations as quiescent as possible. Some analysts suggest that there may also be an element of satisfaction at being free to censure Jews in Israel, relieving European guilt over responsibility for the Holocaust. Finally, it may be that the Europeans simply do not understand that Israel is a democracy at war, living in a mortally dangerous neighborhood, which must act in self-defense in ways that may seem excessive to onlookers in a benign environment such as twenty-first-century western Europe (even though the Western democracies and the United States have used harsher means than Israel in wars far removed from their own territory).

","There's a deep flaw in his strategy. If this file actually has harmful material and isn't just a bluff, what governments would be most harmed by it? Most likely the US, since it appears that much of his focus has been to try to embarrass or harm the US. He has said he's going to go after others, on the other hand, so maybe it will also have stuff on other governments. Nevertheless, the odds are the US is most vulnerable. A strong second would be governments like those in Western Europe, Japan, Australia, and India. Maybe Israel is in here, too. Governments like China, Russia, most of the Muslim world, and most of Africa would not be very vulnerable. Much of South America would also be relatively safe. That's because many of the governments in these regions hold power by force, not by the will of the people. There's just not really anything that could be revealed that would topple them, or really even shake them. Many of them have tight enough control over their press that most of their citizens would never even find out. Another thing many of those in that second group have in common is that they are somewhat at odds with the governments in the first group over many things, and could probably benefit by serious disruption of the governments in the first group. Net result: China, Russia, Iran, probably Pakistan, North Korea, and many others, and also groups like the Taliban and most other Muslim Jihad groups, not to mention most of the right-wing domestic terrorist groups in the US (the militia folks, the radical pro-lifers, and so on), Basque separatists in Europe, and probably many more I've left off, would greatly benefit their agendas if they could trigger the release of the file.

The allegation was that Israel is not providing Gaza Strip with enough supplies. The activists did attack them, and that was wrong. That said, had they not boarded the ship and took other measures, that would not have been possible. Had they not brought guns with them, those guns would not have fallen into the hands of the attackers. The situation would not have gone out of control. From Turkey's viewpoint, it is grounds for war, where nine of Turkey's citizens were killed extralegally without sufficient cause, within neither entity's jurisdiction and thus right. It is difficult not to think the PM would view it as grounds for war, knowing Turkey believes in what it believes in.",0.0,0.0,0.0,negative,0.0

","Most Western countries can't say shit to the Israelis because it would be hypocritical. The imperialist European countries displaced and killed untold numbers when they expanded and colonized. The USA committed multiple cases of mass murder and oppression as well. Canada isn't too squeaky clean either but we try to make up for it by bloating the descendants with our tax dollars. If this Israeli-Palestinian conflict occurred at least 90-100 years ago, the Palestinian problem would've been dealt with in a few short years and we would currently be apathetic to it like we are about the other historic atrocities. However, because of the modern media, because of the progresses in human rights, the Israeli's cannot do what was historically done and that was to simply fuck shit up. Firstly, the ""it-belongs-to-the-natives"" argument is fucking stupid. For thousands of years it was perfectly ""acceptable"" to any native, situated in any part of the world, that if they are conquered then that's that. It is only a recent phenomena that expansionary/colonizing invasions are, for the most apart, illegal and condemned on a global stage. As for the ""Palestinian"" identity, the British were in control of Palestine, and in 1922 decided to turn it into a Jewish state. This slowly occurred leading up to the WW2. During the oppression of the Jews leading up to WW2, and the holocaust during WW2, hundreds of thousands of Jews immigrated or escaped to present-day Israel. Let's not forget that many former Allied countries turned away the fleeing Jews, and many of those Jews paid the ultimate price because of it. Also, I forget who but a very famous individual smuggled, I think, at least 80,000 Jews to Palestine who would have otherwise ended up in concentration camps. When the war ended and we had millions of displaced Jews whose homes had been ransacked, destroyed, or claimed by other parties, the Allies and UN decided it would be easier, or at least chose to, to allow them to go to Palestine; To join what was already becoming a heavily Jewish region. I suppose the British handed over their power to the Israeli's around this point, and so a few days later the neighboring countries invaded Israel. Of course they had every right to, especially since during all this time the Arab population never consented to the intrusion of the Jews or the creation of Israel, ever since 1920 when Britain's mandate to turn Palestine into a Jewish state went into affect. Even before the Arab-Israeli war the Palestinians revolted many times. But in the end, the British were the rulers in Palestine, and they allowed and participated in the settling of Jews onto the region. After the Arab-Israeli war, the Israelis won and conquered most of what remained of Palestine after the creation of Israel. It was later during the 6 day war that the new borders would be solidified. Now, up until this point, I'm actually going to side with Israel. Maybe someone would argue that the UN borders should be the extent of Israel, but Israel can never nor will ever or could have ever gone back to those borders, for any number of reasons... The main one being that the war didn't really end, and the Green Line was where Israel was fortified against any further aggression. Perhaps someone could give me a reasonable argument why I'm wrong. But given the circumstances I just don't see how the Allies would not have allowed the Jews to find a home of their own. Would it have been preferential if they decided to take a rather large empty barren of land like Manitoba or Saskatchewan? Certainly, but no country volunteered as far as I know and in the aftermath of WW2 the European map was altered. I suppose I don't see how the reforming of the Palestinian region is any different. What has happened since the 6 day war is a tragedy, and both sides can share the blame. Now since it is in the modern era, Israel can never hope to conquer what remains of Palestine without some serious international shitstorm. As for the overwhelming counterattacks made by the Israelis, well we can only sit back and admire the work of the Americans and their allies, who, after 9/11, have probably killed or maimed more people in Iraq and Afghanistan then the total population of Palestine. Counterattacks are accepted, at least in Afganistan, so are we going to deny that right to the Israelis? Eh, I don't think that's a very consistent position. Continuing on, the religious aspect that fuels ignorance and hatred for either side is a huge factor in the continuing conflict and it has largely stagnated any political progress to reach a resolution that will satisfy both sides enough to stop any aggressive behavior. Canada and their native population have worked out a non-aggressive solution to their problem, and while it does have problems of its own it certainly beats the helluva the situation in Palestine. As for some observable problems and workable solutions, the Israeli need to stop with the fucking settlements and checkpoints. It would be most advisable if they completely retracted all of it if they ever want peace. Both sides need to do their best and forget the past, especially the Palestinian population since most of them are Muslim and retribution and jihad is a big part of their religion, despite what any moderates say since they probably don't live in Palestine. Not to say the Jewish are squeaky clean either, but after WW2 they are no longer going to lie down and be fucked if they can do anything about it, no matter how ""ahead"" they are. Next, Israel needs to open the borders to the Palestinian people if the Palestinian people want to settle in Israel because the urban occupied areas are overpopulated and unsustainable. Lastly, the neighboring countries and rest of the extremist population in the middle eastern region, need to stop funneling the ignorance and means to retaliate to the Palestinian people. In conclusion, if both sides can stop seeking revenge on the other side for past events, which would be greatly helped out if Israel retracted their settlements, then perhaps this problem can be resolved. If I could look into the future and see this never happens, then I would advise Israel to just annex the rest of Palestine, grant citizenship to the Palestinian people, and get it over with. As far as what many Jews think, they will always be pro-Israel, for whatever convoluted reason, but most of them do not support the settlements or checkpoints, or at least don't realize the extent of the harm it causes. The settlers have an entirely different perspective on things for obvious reasons, hence this crazy article. For those in favor of the expulsion of Israel, or are, at least, pro-Palestinian, they need to start thinking long term and realize Israel is not going anywhere, and that they should focus on the settlements and a two-state solution, and to stop living in the past, which can only help to fuel the Muslim extremist's holy war.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,1.0

2256,"Israel's Peres says Netanyahu blocked 2011 peace deal.
","Okay, a few things. First of all, this article contains hardly any information whatsoever why not post the Times of Israel one? Secondly, this is clearly a case of the Israeli left trying to score points against the right, more of an internal Israeli political matter as opposed to Peres and Abbas having a peace deal laid out and ready to sign, only to be shot down by Netanyahu as I will show. &gt; Speaking to Channel 2 news Tuesday, Peres said that he and Abbas had essentially reached a draft agreement on “almost all issues” and that an accord was being readied, after a series of secret meetings in Jordan. First of all, how can he say he reached a peace agreement, a comprehensive one at that, when they reached a*draft agreement*on*almost all issues**?! An important thing to also add is that we don't know the details of this draft agreement and more importantly, it was made with Abbas who didn't present it to the Palestinians or you know, those guys ruling over 50% of them. &gt; The president told the TV channel that during these talks, which were held in Amman, Abbas agreed to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, a core demand of the Israeli government and a crutch in the most recent round of negotiations. So Abbas agreed to recognize Israel as a Jewish state a few years ago, but now he's making a big deal out of it? Hmm, if you know anything about the modus operandi of Abbas, you'd know he agrees to all sorts of things in private meetings but in public he takes the complete opposite stance; ""Oh I never agreed to such a thing! I would never do x and y!"". &gt; “I’ve known Abu Mazen [as Abbas is known] for 30 years…and the truth is he has fought terror with the resources that he has,” Peres said during the interview. &gt; “He talks about peace and makes courageous remarks” And so we witness the delusion of the Israeli left. Fights terror with the resources he has? Is Peres unaware that Abbas uses a largue sum of his financial resources in paying salaries to convicted terrorists? Does he not know that incitement is rife in PA controlled areas, that terrorists are given a hero's welcome, that street names, schools and parks are named after terrorists? Abbas just sanctioned a state funeral after Israel handed over the body of the Sbarro Restaraunt suicide bomber who killed 15 (7 children and a pregnant woman). Also I challenge Peres and the people in this thread to name me*one*courageous and sincere remark Abbas has made in Arabic to his own people. The Yahoo article also does not include the Prime Minister's Office response: &gt; The Prime Minister’s Office, in response, denied that a Peres-Abbas agreement had been imminent. &gt; “Abu Mazen did not agree to anything. This time around as well, all he wanted was to receive and give nothing in return,” a source at the PMO told the Times of Israel. “This is a known tactic of his, to take an ambiguous stance until he’s pushed into a corner and then flees. This is what happened when he said no at Camp David [in 2000] with [then Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser] Arafat, it’s what happened at Annapolis [in 2008]. He’s done the same thing now with [US Secretary of State John] Kerry when he said no.” &gt; “The only agreement [Abbas reached] was with Hamas.

","And just FYI, here's some info on what this has meant to the Gazans, from an article on the seige at b'tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories. &gt;The three years of the siege caused a grave economic crisis in Gaza, and the extensive damage caused to houses and infrastructure in the course of Operation Cast Lead aggravated the situation. The repercussions include lack of food security among much of the population, high unemployment rates, limited possibilities for earning a living in agriculture, fishing and industry, and harm to the entire fabric of life. According to a survey conducted by the International Red Cross, in May 2008, 70 percent of Gazans were living in poverty, with a monthly income for a 7-9 person family of less than $250 (one dollar a day per person), and 40 percent of urban dwellers were living in deep poverty (a monthly income of less than $120, a half a dollar a day per person). The Red Cross’s figures also showed that, in 2009, 75 percent of the residents, more than 1.1 million persons, lacked food security, compared with 56 percent in 2008, and that dependence of the entire population on external aid was 5 percent higher than before the siege, and stood at 26 percent. According to figures of the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics, in the first quarter of 2010, 33.9 percent of the work force in the Gaza Strip were unemployed, and more than 50 percent of Gazans under age 30 were unemployed. &gt;The decision to ease the siege is welcome, but it is only a small step in the right direction.

","As a forighner who reguarly traverls into and out of Tel Aviv, let me assure you that this article is an idealistic view, it is not reflective of real life. The truth is that you have to get to the airport at least three hours before your flight. This is not the usual 'three hours is actually an hour and a half' thing that we are all used to, its a genuine three hours. And even then, you may still miss your flight due to security holding you up. To be safe, at the busy times of year you genuinly need to allow four hours to clear security. The first thing you need to do is stand in a huge line before check in, they will then scan your bags and 9 times our of 10 you will be flagged for additional screening. They open all of your bags and go through everything, make you power up your laptop and show them pictures of your family and friends, go throgh your email to show them any corrispondence with Isralie companies, etc. They swab literally everything in all of your bags and they will inevitably find something that needs extra scanning, so you wait some more why they wander off with your belongings. Often they will return without your personal belongings and will tell you that it needs yet further additional scanning which will take longer than you have to get on the plane, thus they have confiscated it off you and will ship it to your home within 48 hours. If this happens, you cannot have it back at that point, for that 48 hours it basicly no longer belongs to you. My record for clearing security is one and a half hours, my worst was five hours and a missed flight.

I am a white English guy, usually travel alone on direct flights to and from London and bring a fair mount of electrical equipment with me.

People are comparing them to Saudi Arabia and Iran, which they are not like either of them. If anything, they're closer to the Islamic political parties in Turkey. For one, they're not based on a tribal system of law like Saudi Arabia and they're definitely not based on the Shi'a form which alleviates lots of power to the clergy. If anything, the MB is supported by non-clergical leaders, are Sunni, and are more mainstream than reddit gives them credit for. Why does the Muslim Brotherhood get a bad rep? Do they have a history of governance? In fact, they don't have much of a political history at all aside from getting arrested, tortured, and killed by the current regime. Not to mention, they've been given a bad rep by Western governments that supported dictators and there's a reason for that, if the West didn't demonize the MB, then they had a legitimate chance against the US puppet dictators. People have also compared the Muslim Brotherhood to the Iranian regime. The Iranian regime is a Shi'a regime which is ideologically and politically structured differently from Sunni Islam. In Shi'a Islam, a lot of power is alleviated to the Ayatollahs and the Mullahs. There is no such structure in Sunni Islam. Yeah, you have prominent scholars, but you aren't obligated to follow them. This is fundamentally different from the Iranian structure. Its true that the MB was considered radical by our times during the 1940s and 1950s, but that was during radical times. The MB had to deal with Imperialism from the West, World Was II (considerable fighting did take place in Egypt), the subjugation of the Palestinian population by Israel, the loss of the war against Israel in the 1940s, amongst many other ill informed events. Not to mention, after Gamal Abdel Nasser took Egypt with the help of the Muslim Brotherhood, he outlawed the group and killed thousands of members of the Brotherhood. Its been almost 50 years and the Muslim Brotherhood has changed considerably, it had to, in order to adapt to the changing political climate and has moved to the mainstream in order to garner support amongst the Egyptian populace. Yeah, they're not as mainstream as we would like in the West, but they're not in the West, they're in Egypt and have conformed according to Egyptian society. tl;dr: The MB is not what everyone is making them out to be (which is largely based on Western government bias born out of support for dictatorships.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

","Before my family moved from there when I was 12, we lived in Israel. My entire family served in the IDF, both parents and my brother and sister. My brother, who's 13 years older than me, was once stationed just inside of the West Bank. He was there to protect the settlers. Now, the place is a fucking shithole, these people go there and erect what are essentially mobile homes and just live in them even though there isn't a god damn thing there. At least that's how it was back then. Anyway, my brother and a few others were in charge of protecting a few of those ""houses"". There was nothing to do, they spent most of their time target practicing on cans or the occasional snake or scorpion. Now, you would think those settlers would be grateful for the protection. If some of the Palestinians had their way, they'd fucking slaughter all of them. But no, they actually resented the soldiers being there. My brother asked to use the phone a couple of times to talk with my parents, they refused. Asked to use the bathroom on one occasion due to an emergency, they refused. He fucking asked them for a glass of cold water because all they had was room temperature and it's hot as all fuck over there and the uniforms don't help. They refused. And not politely refused, rude as all fuck and insulting refused. They really treated the soldiers like shit, as if they were their servants, there to protect them no matter how they acted. In a way, they were right. This went on for 2 weeks. Then the bus came to pick them up and drop off new soldiers to take their place. Apparently, my brother's base did not send a replacement for him. After he was on the bus, a commanding officer gave him the news and told him to get off the bus. He said he'd have to stay there for 2 more weeks until his base sent a replacement. My brother told him to tell the bus driver to get going. The officer told him to get off the bus or he'll throw him off. My brother said if he put his hands on him, it wouldn't end well. Officer grabbed him by the uniform and tried to get him up and off the bus. My brother punched him in the face and he dropped. Dude flipped the fuck out and my brother told him that if he doesn't start the bus, he's getting off, loading his weapon and shooting the fuck outta the settlers' houses (no one was home at the time) and that they better leave before this becomes international news tomorrow morning. They ended up leaving with my brother on the bus. He served 2 months in military jail for that. Should have been more but that's a whole other story. Point is, those settlers are pieces of shit who can all go fuck themselves as far as I'm concerned.

","This points out a bigger problem in US-Middle East relations. In every Islamic country, there are basically 2 parties: One party (usually educated, upper-class people) wants to be friends with America because America is the world's superpower and can help them economically, financially, etc... And nobody wants to go to war with America. This party is usually supported by educated, liberal, more secular people, and pretty much everybody that reaches a certain level of sophistication and education in the Middle East wants this party to succeed. The other party's policy is ""Fuck America! They can all eat a bag of dicks"" For this party, they look at America's history in the region, the economic crisis, the Iraq-Afghanistan wars, America's support for dictators and Israel, etc... This party is mostly supported by poorer, dumber people. Unfortunately, the ""Fuck America"" party is getting stronger and stronger (partly because of America's own policies) so the way to gain power in the MidEast is by showing that you hate America the most. So while educated people still want to be friends with America, they realize that the only way they can gain support is by looking like they hate America (and unfortunately, sometimes DOING anti-American shit too). Part of the reason Islamic extremists are gaining so much power is that nothing is more anti-American than extremist Islam and nobody looks like they hate America more than a grown man dressed up like he lives in the 8th century. So this tweet is an example of the Muslim Brotherhood trying to play both sides of the fence.

","Daniel Machover's Letter to the Times (UK) The attack by Israeli forces on the Turkish-registered vessel Mavi Marmara in international waters was clearly unlawful. By virtue of the decision by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Lotus case (1927), the basic principle under customary international law, is that ""...vessels on the high seas are subject to no authority except that of the State whose flag they fly""; in this case, Turkey. Indeed, a 1988 treaty, to which Israel is a party, criminalizes the unlawful and intentional seizure or exercise of control over a ship by force and all connected injuries, deaths and/or detentions. Israel claims that it was lawfully enforcing a legal blockade. Even if the blockade is legal, in order to rely on this legal justification, Israel is required to liaise with the flag state, Turkey, before trying to board the vessel. It did not. In any event, this blockade is not lawful. An embargo on adequate food and medical aid can never be lawful. As the boarding of the Mavi Marmara by Israeli forces was unlawful, those on board had the right to defend themselves, subject to the constraints of Turkish criminal law. Any force used by Israeli commandos may be judged as unlawful, let alone the use of lethal force. Turkey must now be assisted by all UN member states to gain access to all of the evidence relating to this incident so that it may conduct a comprehensive criminal investigation, at the conclusion of which the Israeli personnel involved may need to defend their actions before a criminal court. UN sanctions should be imposed against Israel if it refuses to co-operate with such an investigation. Finally, the unlawful blockade of Gaza must now end.

","Folks, this bears mentioning: Iran is largely without friends in the region. Persians and Arabs have historically had a fractious relationship no matter what, but if anyone in the region's actually happy about the prospect of the Iranian leadership getting nukes, they haven't stepped forward yet. Many Arab politicians are the representatives of miserably undemocratic and repressive regimes, and many of them are woefully incompetent, but they aren't stupid. They may agree with everything that the Iranian leadership says concerning Israel and how it should be wiped off the face of the planet, but that does not necessarily mean that Arabs want to see the Iranians sitting on a bunch of nukes. Let's say for the moment that Iran does get nukes, makes good on its previous threats, and turns Israel into the world's largest parking lot. Great! Israel's gone! Except now there's nuclear fallout all around the region, millions of refugees are flooding into nearby countries, a diplomatic and economic nightmare is all but guaranteed to ensue for a set of countries that can ill afford it, and Irannever a country they were all that terribly fond of to begin withcan bring nukes to bear in any subsequent quarrel. None of this is going to make Iran's neighbors very happy. So Israel, strangely enough, is a perfect solution to a very delicate problem. If Israel actually decided to attack Iranian nuclear facilities, what would the likely reactions be around the region?*Iran would hate them.*Like the Israelis would give a shit. The Iranian government hates them anyway. From their perspective, there is no change to their relationship with Iran if they destroy nascent Iranian nuclear capability.*Arab governments wouldpubliclyrun the gamut from condemnation to total silence.*For PR reasons, most Arab politicians will never say anything supportive of Israel. On one end, you'll get the Qataris trying not to get themselves involved in any diplomatic quarrel. On the other, you'll get massive public protests in places like Egypt.*Arab governments wouldprivatelyrun the gamut from total relief to ... well, total relief:*No one wants the Iranians to get their hands on nukes. Here's a fun little question for all you international relations-type people out there: What happened to Israel's relationships with Arab governments after Operation Opera, when they bombed a nuclear facility being built by Saddam-era Iraq? Answer: Nothing. (Although you can argue that Operation Opera is a good example of why bombing the Iranian facilities would ultimately be counterproductive. I think the stronger argument as to why Israel shouldn't bomb Iran lies here, and not in any discussion concerning a foreign relations problem that would almost certainly not occur.)*So ""Arab policy"" on a potential Israeli strike on Iran is ultimately a wash.*They don't like Israel, but Israel will leave them alone if they leave it alone. They don't like Iran and they don't trust its leadership. Theyreallydon't want Iran to get the bomb because no one's sure what Iran will do with it. Letting Israel smash Iranian nuclear facilities while publicly condemning Israel in order to keep themselves in Iran's good diplomatic graces is an almost effortless solution. You save face domestically, you condemn interstate violence publicly, your relationship with Israel doesn't suffer because Israel honey badgers its way through life in the Middle East anyway, and best of all, the Iranians don't get nukes.*The United States:*Publicly""Bad Israel! No biscuit!"" Privately""Need any more bombs?""*The E.U.:*Publicly""Bad Israel! No biscuit!"" Privately""Do we have any intelligence on what the max range of their missiles is now?""*Russia and China:*Lumping them in together here because, although their foreign policy is quite different, they've both exported key weapons technology to Iran, including Iran's longest-range missile (that's publicly known, anyway). But Iran isn't such a massively important market or concern that either would be willing to go to war on its behalf. If the Iranians do something stupid, they're on their own. Russia/China will make noise in the U.N. At most, they might recall their ambassadors from Israel or even suspend relations. Beyond that ... nope.*North Korea:*It would actually be really interesting to find out just how much help the Iranians have gotten from the North Koreans, though I would hardly expect any of that to come to light from a bombing campaign. It's just an interesting footnote. So there you go. What Saudi Arabia is saying publicly right now has very little to do with what Saudi Arabia would actually allow if Israel provided actionable intelligence concerning an Iranian attempt to build a bomb. If that happens, expect Israel to use their airspace, expect the Saudi Arabians to claim they never gave them permission to do so (""I wasn't here, you weren't here, we never had this discussion, have a nice flight""), and expect neighboring Arab countries to raise a big stink in the U.N. while proceeding to do pretty much nothing re: their actual relationship with Israel, to the extent that they even have one in the first place. Like I said, the better argument against a pre-emptive strike is that it may spur the Iranians to develop nuclear capability more secretly, not that such a strike would adversely impact Israel's relationship with its neighbors.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0
2774,"Gunman who killed three people at a Jewish museum in Belgium was “cold-blooded and very determined”, officials said today, leading some security experts to suggest that he may have been a hitman rather than an anti-Semitic “lone wolf”
","From the article: &gt; One of the Israeli victims, Emmanuel Riva, had formerly worked for Nativ, a government agency that played a covert role in fostering Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union, an Israeli official said. Along with Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, and its domestic security equivalent, Shin Bet, the Nativ agency was under the authority of the Prime Minister’s office. &gt; Miriam Riva, his wife, also once worked for the Prime Minister’s office, the official said without elaborating. To me, the notion that this was purely a random, mindless ""anti-Semitic attack"" seemed unlikely from the beginning, and after seeing the cold, ruthless precision with which the attack was carried out, it seems even more unlikely. 1. The shooting took place at a Jewish museum a place that is frequented not only by Jews, but by the general public. If the shooting had occurred at an Italian restaurant, would it be logical to assume that it was an ""*anti-Italian attack*""? 2. The attack took place on the Jewish Sabbath, a time when the activities and travel of observant Jews is very restricted, meaning that the likelihood of Jews attending the museum on that day would be minimized. 3. As it was the Sabbath, anyone who was even remotely familiar with Jewish customsandwho sought to randomly target Jews would know that places such as synagogues would present a far higher number of potential targets. 3. Here is a photo of the Israeli couple that was murdered. Is there anything about the appearance of these folks that would indicate that they are Jewish/Israeli? Any characteristics that would distinguish them from any random couple who might have been visiting the museum? 4. The article states that""one of the Israeli victims, Emmanuel Riva, had formerly worked for Nativ,a government agency that played a COVERT ROLE in fostering Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union""*, and that Miriam Riva ""*also once worked for the Prime Minister’s office""*. These details may or may not be relevant, but the secretive nature of Emmanuel's work would seem to add weight to the possibility that the couple may have been specifically targeted asindividuals*, rather than as ""random Jews"". Naturally the Israeli government (and other Jewish leaders) immediately pounced on these brutal murders asa random act of senseless anti-Semitic violence*, as these types of incidents effectively serve their political agenda by instilling fear in Jews everywhere, and in eliciting sympathy worldwide, but as more details emerge, the idea that this was a random ""hate crime"" or act of ""terrorism"" seems less likely.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

","The West bank will not likely agree to this anymore. The PLO will come up with some reason, probably that they will not give up Jerusalem (and that will be the Israeli reason too, or some other major settlement anyways). Even if the PLO thought they could maintain political power in a new Palestine, which is unlikely given that they failed to overthrow Hamas with US support, Israel will always reject the '67 borders (more on that later). Hamas would take over all of Palestine, and then not take a heavy stand against violence against Israel. The PLO in WB will stonewall any effort that would jeopardize their power in the WB. Despite Israeli occupation of the WB, the PLO has more power then if Israel were to back off and go with a 2 state solution. Why? Iran-backed Hamas would take power and not peacefully relinquish it. An election should have been held in GS by now but it keeps being postphoned, and will likely contine to be postphoned as long as Hamas has sufficient local support. Hamas maintains control of GS by maintaining the conflict, otherwise the other ""weaker"" parties will gain support... There will not be peace with Hamas. Further, if Palestine were united and had full control, it eliminates the red tape Israel pretty much ignores already, which makes a PR war against Israel more difficult since they would no longer be sanctioned or occupied. The Israeli government could exercise all their actions without restraint if rockets or bombings continued to occur. Israel knows this, and so why go through the process of evicting the &gt;500k Israeli settlers, and lose the next election, only to deal with the same violent conflict anyways. As long as Israel has no confidence in the possibility of peace with political groups that are not likely to ever stop their attacks, there is practically nothing that will persuade Israel to a 2 state plan other than a Palestinian offer of complete concession of all the land illegally taken by Israel. The Israeli government is not going to want to piss off their right wing voters by giving up land, just so the whole Israeli population will get pissed off when the attacks do not cease anyways. Israel already made that political mistake when they pulled out of GS and then Hamas got elected. Iran and militant groups will do all they can to undermine peace for Israel, the Palestinian people do not have a chance against such influence, especially considering how much most despise Israel given the terrible history. Even if the Palestinian political parties do agree with Israel on some border plan, there are simply too many militants or extremists who hate Israel and will do all they can to hinder peace. Such localized driven violence happen everytime the Palestinian government even negotiates on border proposals... How comforted do you think Israel is of a 2 state plan if violence against settlers escalate everytime negotiations begin? The Palestinian people revolted when the Palestine papers came out, and Israel rejected it aswell and it gave Israel land beyond the '67 borders...

","Redditors, We are shocked at the amount of anti-semitism being voiced on your website, and feel the need to set the record straight. First of all, the incident did NOT happen in international waters. 68 miles is less than 12 miles if you measure the distance using God’s chosen yardstick. Please watch this video, helpfully provided by the IDF, that shows the other side of the story. Emerging from Cobra helicopters armed with triple barreled 20mm cannons and 70mm rockets, heroic IDF soldiers rapelled down carrying standard issue 9mm sidearms, tear gas, combat knives and SPAS-12 shotguns. They were essentially defenseless against the onslaught of high tech poles and chairs that confronted them. After witnessing the beating of a defenseless soldier, it became clear that these Nazi “activists” were hell bent on pushing all the Jews into the sea. Israel had to act swiftly to deal with the attack, and deployed more soldiers. Here the footage clearly shows a soldier carrying a paintball gun, proving Israel was only trying to join the Turkish paintball league. We ask you this: If your paintball team was attacked, wouldn’t you fight back? And if the other team were carrying non-regulation throwing chairs, wouldn’t you be justified in pulling out your 7.62mm assault rifle to even the odds? As more soldiers descended from helicopters, it is important to clarify that ONLY 10 activists were shot dead. SixmillionJews died in the holocaust. An eye for an eye, and 12 million eyes for 12 million eyes. We win. Finally, after the brave defenders of Israel were mercilessly beaten back, suffering ZERO casualties in the process (a testament to Israel’s superiority), the terrorist vessels were intercepted, and the truth was finally revealed. This IDF video contains incontrovertible evidence that the flotillas were armed to the teeth, ready to kill Israeli citizens on a moment’s notice. Flares of mass destruction There is no legitimate reason why seabound vessels would EVER carry emergency flares. The flares were clearly going to be used in the manufacturing of rockets that would be fired at Israeli cities. Slingshots of mass destruction This screenshot of slingshots and glass jars full of rocks was definitely not a fabrication that builds on the stereotype of Palestinians being a bunch of primitive stone throwers. Militant activist ships load up on slingshots and rocks all the time. In fact, just last week Greenpeace sent 5000 slingshots to help overthrow Kim Jong Il. Israel has a right to defend itself and we will not allow this to happen to our country. Kitchen knives and a very scary looking Arabian dagger Notice how they are conveniently placed on top of amuslimflag, right next to a conveniently placedkeffiyeh*. If this doesn’t prove that scary muslims are out to kill you, I don’t know what will. Perhaps the most sinister of the weaponry found on board, was this glass bottle, capable of holding enough toxic gas to wipe out an entire continent. Or enough high fructose corn syrup to make a gerbil overweight. Either way, Israel had to act. Look guys, here are the facts: The IDF only receives $6 billion per year in funding from the USA, a mere 30% of total foreign aid. We simply do not have the resources to fake footage of rusty knives, bottles and rocks. The IDF would not do this. The IDF has never lied in the past and it never will. The bottom line is that those flotillas were carrying pebbles of mass destruction, and Israel has every right to defend itself in any way it sees fit. You can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, and you can’t run a peaceful democracy without killing a few activists. Yours sincerely, AIPAC P.S. You are all anti-semites. And you never call.

[ ] Israel made the desert bloom and we have beautiful beaches. [ ] The Jews have been persecuted for thousands of years. [x] All arabs want to push the Jews into the sea. [x] Israel is a shining example of democracy and ethnic discrimination does not exist. [x] Suicide bombers are killing Israeli citizens and collective punishment will put a stop to this eventually. [x] The IDF are showing remarkable restraint; They have the power to nuke the entire region but choose not to. [x] It is the fault of the Palestinians that they don't rebuild infrastructure fast enough after we bomb it. [x] Arafat walked out on camp David, proving that 100% of Palestinians want war, not peace. [ ] The Jews are God's chosen people and this is the land that was promised to us by a book. [ ] It is not a genocide until hundreds of thousands of Palestinans are killed and we aren't even close to that yet. [x] 100% of Palestinians are terrorists. [ ] The Arabs drove the Jews from their homeland thousands of years ago so it is about time for some payback. [ ] Israel has killed fewer people than Iran or Iraq which means we are a peaceful state. [ ] Carpet bombing an entire country is a perfectly rational response to the kidnapping of a soldier. [x] It's not a concentration camp, it's a safety wall! Therefore, your claim of [Israel attacking a humanitarian aid flotilla in international waters] is false and we should continue to send money and military support to Israel.

3196,"On 6/5, 65 Things We Know About NSA Surveillance That We Didn’t Know a Year Ago
","1. We saw an example of the court orders that authorize the NSA to collect virtually every phone call record in the United States—that’s who you call, who calls you, when, for how long, and sometimes where. 2. We saw NSA Powerpoint slides documenting how the NSA conducts “upstream” collection, gathering intelligence information directly from the infrastructure of telecommunications providers. 3. The NSA has created a “content dragnet” by asserting that it can intercept not only communications where a target is a party to a communication but also communications “about a target, even if the target isn’t a party to the communication.” 4. The NSA has confirmed that it is searching data collected under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act to access American’s communications without a warrant, in what Senator Ron Wyden called the ""back door search loophole."" 5. Although the NSA has repeatedly stated it does not target Americans, its own documents show that searches of data collected under Section 702 are designed simply to determine with 51 percent confidence a target’s “foreignness.’” 6. If the NSA does not determine a target’s foreignness, it will not stop spying on that target. Instead the NSA will presume that target to be foreign unless they “can be positively identified as a United States person.” 7. A leaked internal NSA audit detailed 2,776 violations of rules or court orders in just a one-year period. 8. Hackers at the NSA target sysadmins, regardless of the fact that these sysadmins themselves may be completely innocent of any wrongdoing. 9. The NSA and CIA infiltrated games and online communities like World of Warcraft and Second Life to gather data and conduct surveillance. 10. The government has destroyed evidence in EFF’s cases against NSA spying. This is incredibly ironic, considering that the government has also claimed EFF’s clients need this evidence to prove standing. 11. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied to Congress when asked directly by Sen. Ron Wyden whether the NSA was gathering any sort of data on millions of Americans. 12. Microsoft, like other companies, has cooperated closely with the FBI to allow the NSA to “circumvent its encryption and gain access to users’ data.” 13. The intelligence budget in 2013 alone was $52.6 billion— this number was revealed by a leaked document, not by the government. Of that budget, $10.8 billion went to the NSA. That’s approximately $167 per person in the United States. 14. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has issued orders that allow the NSA to share raw data—without personally identifying information stripped out— with the FBI, CIA, and the National Counterterrorism Center. 15. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding, the NSA regularly shares raw data with Israel without stripping out personally identifying information about U.S. persons. 16. The Snowden disclosures have made it clear the Obama administration misled the Supreme Court about key issues in ACLU’s case against NSA spying, Clapper v. Amnesty International, leading to the dismissal of the case for lack of standing. 17. The NSA “hacked into Al Jazeera's internal communications system.” NSA documents stated that “selected targets had ‘high potential as sources of intelligence.’” 18. The NSA used supposedly anonymous Google cookies as beacons for surveillance, helping them to track individual users. 19. The NSA “intercepts ‘millions of images per day’ — including about 55,000 ‘facial recognition quality images’” and processes them with powerful facial recognition software. 20. The NSA facial recognition program “can now compare spy satellite photographs with intercepted personal photographs taken outdoors to determine the location.” 21. Although most NSA reform has focused on Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, and most advocates have also pushed for reform of Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, some of the worst NSA spying happens under the authority of Executive Order 12333, which President Obama could repeal or modify today. 22. The NSA collected Americans’ cell phone location information for two years as part of a pilot project to see how it could use such information in its massive databases. 23. In one month, March 2013, the NSA collected 97 billion pieces of intelligence from computer networks worldwide, including 3 billion pieces of intelligence from US computer networks. 24. The NSA has targeted Tor, a set of tools that allow Internet users to browse the net anonymously. 25. The NSA program MUSCULAR infiltrates links between the global data centers of technology companies such as Google and Yahoo. Many companies have responded to MUSCULAR by encrypting traffic over their internal networks. 26. The XKEYSCORE program analyzes emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals anywhere in the world. 27. NSA undermines the encryption tools relied upon by ordinary users, companies, financial institutions, targets, and non-targets as part of BULLRUN, an unparalleled effort to weaken the security of all Internet users, including you. 28. The NSA’s Dishfire operation has collected 200 million text messages daily from users around the globe, which can be used to extract valuable information such as location data, contact retrievals, credit card details, missed call alerts, roaming alerts (which indicate border crossings), electronic business cards, credit card payment notifications, travel itinerary alerts, and meeting information. 29. Under the CO-TRAVELER operation, the US collects location information from global cell towers, Wi-Fi, and GPS hubs, which is then information analyzed over time, in part in order to determine a target’s traveling companions. 30. A 2004 memo entitled “DEAThe ‘Other’ Warfighter”, states that the DEA and NSA “enjoy a vibrant two-way information-sharing relationship.” 31. When the DEA acts on information its Special Operations Division receives from the NSA, it cloaks the source of the information through “parallel construction,” going through the charade of recreating an imaginary investigation to hide the source of the tip, not only from the defendant, but from the court. This was intended to ensure that no court rules on the legality or scope of how NSA data is used in ordinary investigations.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

3246,"The Settlements Aren't the Problem - The Palestinians' beef with Israel isn't territorial—it's existential.
","For those who cannot access the whole article, here it is: I once got an angry letter from Baruch Goldstein's father. Goldstein, remember, was an Israeli settler who in 1994 entered the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and gunned down 29 Muslim worshippers. A decade later, I wrote a column for the Jerusalem Post in which I described Goldstein as personifying Israel's lunatic extreme. The father insisted that his son deserved to be celebrated as a hero. Indeed, his grave site was transformed into a shrine until the Israeli army eventually tore it down. It's easy to dislike Israel's settlements, and still easier to dislike many of the settlers. Whatever your view about the legality or justice of the enterprise, it takes a certain cast of mind to move your children to places where they are more likely to be in harm's way. In the current issue of the American Interest, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer persuasively spells out the many ways in which the settlement movement has undermined Israel's own rule of law, and hence its democracy. And as last week's diplomatic eruption over the prospective construction of 1,600 housing units in municipal Jerusalem shows, the settlements are a constant irritant to the United States, one friend Israel can't afford to lose. So it would be a splendid thing for Israel to tear down its settlements, put the settlers behind its pre-1967 borders and finally reach the peace deal with the Palestinians that has been so elusive for so long.*Except for one problem: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict isn't territorial. It's existential.*Israelis are now broadly prepared to live with a Palestinian state along their borders. Palestinians are not yet willing to live with a Jewish state along theirs. That should help explain why it is that in the past decade, two Israeli prime ministers—Ehud Barak in 2000 and Ehud Olmert in 2008—have put forward comprehensive peace offers to the Palestinians, and have twice been rebuffed. In both cases, the offers included the division of Jerusalem; in the latter case, it also included international jurisdiction over Jerusalem's holy places and concessions on the subject of Palestinian refugees. Current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also offered direct peace talks. The Palestinians have countered by withdrawing to ""proximity talks"" mediated by the U.S. It also helps explain other aspects of Palestinian behavior. For Hamas, Tel Aviv is no less a ""settlement"" than the most makeshift Jewish outpost on the West Bank. The supposedly moderate Fatah party has joined that bandwagon, too: Last year, Mohammed Dahlan, one of Fatah's key leaders, said the party was ""not bound"" by the 1993 Oslo Accords through which the PLO recognized Israel. Then there is the test case of Gaza. When Israel withdrew all of its settlements from the Strip in 2005, it was supposed to be an opportunity for Palestinians to demonstrate what they would do with a state if they got one. Instead, they quickly turned it into an Iranian-backed Hamas enclave that for nearly three years launched nonstop rocket and mortar barrages against Israeli civilians. Israel was ultimately able to contain that violence, but only at the price of a military campaign that was vehemently denounced by the very people who had urged Israel to withdraw in the first place. As it happens, I supported Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, bloody-minded neocon though I am. On balance, I still think it was the right thing to do. By 2005, Israel's settlements in the Strip had become military and political liabilities. But there is a duty to take account of subsequent developments. And the sad fact is that the most important thing Israel's withdrawal from Gaza accomplished was to expose the fanatical irredentism that still lies at the heart of the Palestinian movement. The withdrawal exposed other things too. For years, Israel's soi-disant friends, particularly in Europe, had piously insisted that they supported Israel's right to self-defense against attacks on Israel proper. But none of them lifted a finger to object to the rocket attacks from Gaza, while they were outspoken in denouncing Israel's ""disproportionate"" use of retaliatory force. Similarly, Israel withdrew from Gaza with assurances from the Bush administration that the U.S. would not insist on a return to the 1967 borders in brokering any future deal with the Palestinians. But Hillary Clinton reneged on that commitment last year, and now the administration is going out of its way to provoke a diplomatic crisis with Israel over a construction project that—assuming it ever gets off the ground—is plainly in keeping with past U.S. undertakings. In the past decade, Israelis have learned that neither Palestinians nor Europeans can be taken at their word. That's a lesson they may soon begin to draw about the U.S. as well. Which is a pity for many reasons—not least because it gives the settler movement every excuse it needs to keep rolling right along.",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

","The Obama administration believes that the Muslim Brotherhood is an acceptable player in forming a new government in Egypt despite the fact that about a dozen very public quotes from the former and current leaders of the Brotherhood, which I provided in a Pajamas Media article last week, reveal the Brotherhood’s Salafi-jihadi worldview and support for Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. These quotes are readily available to anyone who wants to take the time to look for them, but the Obama team’s acceptance of the Brotherhood is all the more mystifying due to the fact that the government’s own classified State Department cables document that Iran, our arch-enemy in the region, has been clandestinely supporting it as a proxy in Egypt. This information is contained in a classified June 29, 2010, cable from the American Embassy in Cairo titled “General Petraeus’ Meeting With EGIS Chief Soliman,” in which General Petraeus, then the commander of Central Command, and Omar Soliman, then the chief of the Egyptian General Intelligence Service, discussed this specific threat. During the conversation, Soliman complained to Petraeus that: “Egypt suffers from Iranian interference through its Hezbollah and Hamas proxies, and its support for…the Muslim Brotherhood….We hope Iran will stop supporting Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and other cells.” It should be noted here that Hamas, listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. government, is not an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood.

","I wish the Jewish people of the world weren't so brainwashed while they were growing up to unconditionally love Israel. If for only one second they would take off their blinders and acknowledge the negativity of the settlements and do something about it, then maybe progress will be made. But as long as they continue to build settlements, peace is impossible. It has been this way for the past 40 years. You cannot expect to come to an agreement on the sovereignty between 2 nations if 1 nation is continuously annexing one piece after another of the other nation's land. All the terrorist activities perpetrated against the Israelis are completely irrelevant to Israel's decision to continue to settlement building process. On the other hand, some of the terrorist activities perpetrated against the Israelis are a result of Israel's settlement building process. There is something a lot of non-Israelis, and non-Jewish people, don't realize with respect to Israel. Jews love having a Jewish homeland, and allowing the usual Right to Return provision in any peace negotiation will end any chance of an agreement because the Jewish people do not want to become a minority[which would result if Palestinians were allowed back into the country]. Being a majority in a country gives them a special feeling when they go to Israel, something they don't get anywhere else. Now I'm uncertain as to whether or not such provisions are still being considered in modern day peace talks, but rest assured, unless Israel was invaded by the rest of the world, in order to open her borders, she will never unilaterally open her doors. Palestinian leaders know Israel will never agree to such terms yet they persist in their attempts at pushing forward that provision, thus Israelis could care less about achieving peace when peace won't ever be achieved on their terms. Israelis will gladly trade security for a Jewish homeland as long as they are backed by the USA's massively huge military, and heavy political and economic influence. It's unfortunate that there wasn't some sizable deserted island somewhere that we could have plotted all the pre-WW2 persecution refugees and post-WW2 holocaust survivors (since most of the world was pretty reluctant with respect to opening their borders). Anyways, Israeli political leaders won't halt the settlement building process because they do not benefit from doing so whatsoever, with respect to garnering support from their constituents. In fact, as long as the Jews of the world continue to be apathetic towards the settlement building, the only result to a politicians career if they try to halt the building process would be the find themselves out of a job because they will lose the very influential pro-settlement vote (They are like the Christian Right of the USA). In addition, the constituents (pro, anti, and neutral settlement voters) don't give a shit about the rest of the world because they have an inferiority complex as a result of their upbringing that teaches them all about the hardships inflicted upon the Jewish people by the rest of the world... which is quite factual in any case. However, this complex seeps into equating anti-Israeli rhetoric as being anti-Semitic, another unfortunate result of a Jewish-Israeli upbringing (even when you're not Israeli) thus it's difficult for them to think about the situation objectively and think it possible that the Israeli government could be complicit in committing crimes. As an atheist, I personally find ethno-nationalism useless and dangerous, but that's the Jewish perspective.*TLDR**: Jews want a country where they are the majority thus they will not agree to a Right to Return provision which Palestinians demand for in their negotiations + It is political suicide for an Israeli politician to advocate for the abolition of settlement building because of the fundamentalist voting blocs + Ethno-nationalism is useless and dangerouslast edit",0.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0.0

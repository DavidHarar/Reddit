The Palestinians use the fact that there are (few) settlements around East Jerusalem claiming that this does not allow them to expand and cry foul play.

745," U.N. Should Accept Palestine as a Full Member State - 
Why Israel &amp; the US are on the wrong side of history
","For those wondering why Palestinians shouldn't be granted statehood, here's a thoughtThere is no government for Palestine. A plan to unify Fatah and Hamas (West bank and Gaza) was drafted last April, and the first elections for a new government are scheduled for May, but it's not clear whether this will actually happen and much less clear if the elections will be fair. Even worse, Palestinian people could choose Hamas to control their government. Why should the world recognize a Hamas-led government if Hamas refuses to recognize Israel? On the peace side of things, there can be no peace until a unified Palestinian government exists that is moderate enough to accept it and strong enough to enforce it. In the mean time, most Israelis have given up on peace. Throughout history, when Israelis have made concessions, Palestinians have turned those concessions against them. When Israel handed over control of the Gaza Strip to the Palestinians in 1994 (Oslo Accords), terrorist organizations started using the land as a launch pad for mortar attacks, and the Palestinian people elected a government bent on the destruction of Israel. On the other hand, when Israel takes land, it ends up being safer. So Israelis have given up. They have decided that there can be no peace and so they are making arrangements for the next best thingtaking away the power of the Palestinians to engage in war. This is why you see a much tougher stance against Palestinians being taken by the current Israeli government. I am an Israeli-American. I personally don't agree with the settlement construction. I would love nothing more than to see a prosperous Palestinian nation living alongside Israel and I would be willing to make many concessions for peace, but for many in Israel, that dream is dead. It's not hard to see why.*TL;DR**: Can't grant Palestinian statehood until they have a unified government, can't have peace without unified, peaceful, and strong government. Israel has mostly given up on peace, causing the settlement construction and lack of peace talks you see today.","To grant Palestinian statehood, a unified government is necessary.

849,"Iran will produce nuclear weapons if attacked: Russia
","I don't want to get into this argument because for obvious reason. Logically, it would be in Iran's best interest to develop nuclear weapon to hedge against all the threats being directed at Iran by Israel, America, United Kingdom, France, Saudi Arabia, and many other countries. I think Iranians aren't bad shit crazy to actually use a nuclear weapon on anyone. Don't forget Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has a PhD. Education has a surprisingly effect on diminishing batshit-craziness. So he'd never opt for a nuclear attack. But I expect him to say ""all options are on the table"" like every other country. Attacking Iran now would be a mistake. It will not only shatter the already weak world economy that's just starting to recover but it will only put Iran back just a few years. A large scale occupation of Iran (like Iraq and Afghanistan) is impossible. Iranians are highly educated compared to goat-fuckers of Iraq and donkey-fuckers of Afghanistan. So eventually Iran would get the weapon. What then? I think the best solution is telling Iran that it can use nuclear technology for civilian purpose with full monitoring of its nuclear program by international body until to a date when Iran convinces that world that it is so enlightened that it would never imagine using nuclear weapon. Of course all the sanctions would have to be lifted also. I base all of this argument on the fact that if you squeeze a ball enough, it will convex and protrude . But apply enough force, and the ball will burst. Likewise, pressure Iran enough and it will bend to everyone's will. But if the pressure gets beyond a point of no return, Iran will burst. I'd rather not see a country burst.","Iran's development of nuclear weapons is a logical response to the threats it faces from multiple countries. However, using them is unlikely due to the education and rationality of its leaders. Attacking Iran now would be a mistake, as it would only delay their acquisition of nuclear technology and cause economic damage. A better solution is to allow Iran to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes with international monitoring until they can prove their commitment to non-proliferation. Pressure can be effective, but excessive",1.0

However, D.C. insiders are 99% in favor of letting Israel sodomize Uncle Sam with a pointy stick. Okay, perhaps that is a little extreme, but nothing short of such a shocking assertion can exaggerate the extent to which established Republicans and established Democrats tend to believe that providing for the defense of Israel is nearly as (or perhaps even more) important a security priority than our own national defense. Though there may be a little bit of fundraising at issue here, the bigger issue is the warped culture of the military-industrial complex. American Jews and even Israeli citizens are very rarely half as militant as American politicians and the current crop of Israeli politicians in power. Elected elites seem to believe that pulling fuel from the fires of hatred in the Middle East would precipitate some sort of disaster. Ordinary citizens both over there and over here seem to believe a less militant Israel would be good for both regional and global peace (and therefore also security.) If only elections actually worked to convey messages like this from the masses to their/our rulers, we would be able to see much less insane policies and much less insane rhetoric shaping the course of events in the Middle East. To put it simply Benjamin Netanyahu pushes hard during this American election year because bellicose behavior strengthens his own base of support, and he correctly believes almost everyone in the White House and on Capitol Hill is simply too brainwashed by D.C. culture to even consider scaling back America's most costly and least productive foreign entanglement.

I guess he's all politics though so this is barely applicable to his stance.

I don't think that it is justified to declare that these are intimate personal information that can be kept secret. I think if somebody is running for office, religion or sexual orientation aren't private matters either (I mean it's legitimate to inquire for these too). Discriminating, barring somebody for religion or sexual orientation would be a no-no of course. Now, regarding dual citizenship the question is whether these people are a security risk or not. Dual citizenship implies dual allegiance, and would you like to see somebody holding office in your country who has allegiance to some other state, which you regard a rival of your country, with contradicting interest with your country? (No, I don't think that a person with Israeli citizenship is automatically falling to this category, but some might think so). For example Slovakia entirely banned dual citizenship and ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia who took up Hungarian citizenship were stripped from Slovakian citizenship, lest from holding govt office. I don't agree with that (as a Hungarian) but the EU and other international institutions tolerated that and regard this as Slovakia's internal matters. So theoretically, if we Hungarians strip Jews (or non-jews for that matter) who took up Israeli citizenship from Hungarian citizenship would be entirely our business too (not that I'd want that).","As a Hungarian, I believe that dual citizenship raises questions about potential security risks and allegiance to other states.

Not only have they imported rockets, but in the pass they have stolen water pipes and light poles in order to fashion them into rocket launchers. The blockade is both to protect Israeli's and Palestinians because if Hamas gets this gear it becomes a security risk for all those involved. Israel prefers to pass the goods through customs to prevent weapons from coming in, and then put them in the hands of NGO's based in Gaza that will use the goods for the intended purpose not for violence. In conclusion I like how these people decided not to bring medical aid to Syria, but instead bring soccer balls to Gaza by breaking the U.N recognized legal blockade in a radical fashion that could have been avoided if they had gone through the proper channels and docked the ship in Ashdod. True priorities.","Despite my sympathy for the Gazans, I believe this media stunt is pointless.

2400,"Pajamas Media » What the Murder of Iraqi Jews in 1941 Tells us About the Middle East Today
","Seventy years ago during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, June 1st and 2nd, 1941, Iraqis rampaged through the Jewish sections of Baghdad, killing between 100 and 600 individuals, injuring countless more, and looting whatever they could. This was the turning point in the history of Iraqi Jews, who had resided in Mesopotamia for over 2,500 years. In the decade that followed, the community was systematically disenfranchised, robbed, and largely expelled. What lessons does this hold for understanding the Middle East of today? The pogrom known as the Farhud (“violent dispossession”) was conducted by Iraqis. On the first day the perpetrators were soldiers, policemen, and Baghdadis, and on the second, Bedouin from outside the city eager to claim their toll of Jews and share of loot. But the Farhud also came at the point at which the Nazi-inspired and supported coup against the pro-British Iraqi monarchy was destroyed. Like the Holocaust, it is an opportunity to examine the nature of hatred in past and present. The question of the Nazi relationship with the Muslim and Arab worlds is far from new. Indeed, even before World War II, British and Zionist officials took note of the relationship between the “grand mufti of Jerusalem,” Haj Amin al-Husseini, and the Nazis. Long a thorn in the side of both, the mufti had been foolishly appointed by the British as the chief Muslim religious official in Jerusalem. In return, he schemed against them, the Jews, and Arab rivals from Palestine to Iraq, fomenting hatred and terrorism. Central to his ideology, and personality, was rabid hatred of Jews. Within days of Hitler’s ascent to power the mufti reached out to Nazi officials. His later record of Nazi collaboration is exceptional: conspiring against the British in Iraq after his flight from Palestine; broadcasting to the Arab world from Berlin; and raising Muslim SS divisions in the Balkans. Only by escaping to Egypt after the war with French help did he avoid a war crimes trial. But how much were he and his minions actually inspired by Nazism? And, to the extent that he was the central Muslim figure railing against Jews and Zionism before and after World War II, how much was Palestinian and Arab opposition ‘”Nazi-inspired” or even a local manifestation of Nazism? Did this contribute to today’s “Islamo-fascism”? Direct Nazi support for the mufti and for local fascists in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Iran was late, but when war came it was deep and pervasive. Money and arms flowed, and German forces entered Iraq from Vichy Syria in May 1941 to support the Sunni military officers who had launched the coup, with the encouragement of the German ambassador, Fritz Grobba. Incitement against the Jews of Iraq had been heightened by years of classroom propaganda by Palestinian Arab and Syrian teachers facilitated by the Minister of Education and Nazi enthusiast Sami Shawkat, propaganda broadcasts from Germany, and by semi-military fascist societies. In return, there was extensive Muslim support for the Nazis, as subversives in the Middle East, SS troops in the Balkans, and through the mufti’s direct support for the Holocaust. It was he who went relentlessly from office to office urging Nazi officials not to barter Jews, including children, in exchange for goods but to send them to their deaths in Poland.","In 1941, during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, Iraqis violently attacked and killed between 100 and 600 Jews in Baghdad, injuring countless more and looting their possessions.

","Redditors, We are shocked at the amount of anti-semitism being voiced on your website, and feel the need to set the record straight. First of all, the incident did NOT happen in international waters. 68 miles is less than 12 miles if you measure the distance using God’s chosen yardstick. Please watch this video, helpfully provided by the IDF, that shows the other side of the story. Emerging from Cobra helicopters armed with triple barreled 20mm cannons and 70mm rockets, heroic IDF soldiers rapelled down carrying standard issue 9mm sidearms, tear gas, combat knives and SPAS-12 shotguns. They were essentially defenseless against the onslaught of high tech poles and chairs that confronted them. After witnessing the beating of a defenseless soldier, it became clear that these Nazi “activists” were hell bent on pushing all the Jews into the sea. Israel had to act swiftly to deal with the attack, and deployed more soldiers. Here the footage clearly shows a soldier carrying a paintball gun, proving Israel was only trying to join the Turkish paintball league. We ask you this: If your paintball team was attacked, wouldn’t you fight back? And if the other team were carrying non-regulation throwing chairs, wouldn’t you be justified in pulling out your 7.62mm assault rifle to even the odds? As more soldiers descended from helicopters, it is important to clarify that ONLY 10 activists were shot dead. SixmillionJews died in the holocaust. An eye for an eye, and 12 million eyes for 12 million eyes. We win. Finally, after the brave defenders of Israel were mercilessly beaten back, suffering ZERO casualties in the process (a testament to Israel’s superiority), the terrorist vessels were intercepted, and the truth was finally revealed. This IDF video contains incontrovertible evidence that the flotillas were armed to the teeth, ready to kill Israeli citizens on a moment’s notice. Flares of mass destruction There is no legitimate reason why seabound vessels would EVER carry emergency flares. The flares were clearly going to be used in the manufacturing of rockets that would be fired at Israeli cities. Slingshots of mass destruction This screenshot of slingshots and glass jars full of rocks was definitely not a fabrication that builds on the stereotype of Palestinians being a bunch of primitive stone throwers. Militant activist ships load up on slingshots and rocks all the time. In fact, just last week Greenpeace sent 5000 slingshots to help overthrow Kim Jong Il. Israel has a right to defend itself and we will not allow this to happen to our country. Kitchen knives and a very scary looking Arabian dagger Notice how they are conveniently placed on top of amuslimflag, right next to a conveniently placedkeffiyeh*. If this doesn’t prove that scary muslims are out to kill you, I don’t know what will. Perhaps the most sinister of the weaponry found on board, was this glass bottle, capable of holding enough toxic gas to wipe out an entire continent. Or enough high fructose corn syrup to make a gerbil overweight. Either way, Israel had to act. Look guys, here are the facts: The IDF only receives $6 billion per year in funding from the USA, a mere 30% of total foreign aid. We simply do not have the resources to fake footage of rusty knives, bottles and rocks. The IDF would not do this. The IDF has never lied in the past and it never will. The bottom line is that those flotillas were carrying pebbles of mass destruction, and Israel has every right to defend itself in any way it sees fit. You can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, and you can’t run a peaceful democracy without killing a few activists. Yours sincerely, AIPAC P.S. You are all anti-semites. And you never call.
